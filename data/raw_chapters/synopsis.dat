A STUDY IN SCARLET
"A Study in Scarlet" is the story of how Sherlock Holmes solved the murder of Joseph Stangerson (and later, Enoch Drebber). The book is written from the perspective of Dr. John Watson, a retired Afghanistan soldier and doctor, who accompanies Holmes on his investigations in Victorian England. On meeting Holmes through an old friend, Watson is astounded with his brilliant observation skills and they agree to be flatmates and split rent for an apartment on 221B Baker Street. When the police (head detectives Lestrade and Gregson) show up at their doorstep, stumped by a crime, they turn to amateur detective Sherlock Holmes for help. As Holmes walks up the driveway to Number 3, Lauriston Gardens, he does not fail to observe even the tiniest of details that might help crack the case. He eyes a drunkard, who was wandering around the front of a house. Upon entering the crime scene, he bends over the face of the dead man and inhales. "'Poison,' said Sherlock Holmes curtly" (Doyle 30). While examining the room in which Joseph Stangerson was murdered, Holmes found a container of pills and a wedding ring; there was the German word 'Rache' (which means revenge) smeared on the wall in blood. The case seemed complicated- almost unsolvable- but Holmes thought otherwise. He took Watson and returned home to 221B. They then placed an advertisement in the newspaper for the wedding ring which they found at the crime scene, but the wedding ring was only a dead end. The investigation continued. One day, Detective Gregson bursts into the apartment, exclaiming that he had caught the criminal. He announced Enoch Drebber as murderer just moments before Lestrade enters the room with news: Enoch Drebber had been murdered that morning. Of course, Holmes knew that already. As he begins to explain, the book switches into a flashback. The scene is set in North America, in the Alkali Plains. John Ferrier (a traveler in his mid-fifties) and a little girl (Lucy Ferrier) were lost, wandering in the desert for days without food or water. Finally, the man collapsed with the child and prepared to die as Lucy's mother and the other travelers had. But Mormon emigrants heading to Utah found the two and brought them to live with them as long as they converted to Mormonism. Having no choice, but thankful for safety, the two moved into the Mormon community. John Ferrier became a wealthy man and Lucy blossomed into a beautiful young woman and they lived happily as father and daughter. One day, Lucy went out to round up some cattle and would have been trampled if the handsome Jefferson Hope, a Protestant hunter who was in the area, had not saved her. From there, the two fell in love. John Ferrier secretly hated the Mormon community, but knew not to speak out about it, since the Mormons ruled with fear* and whoever spoke out about it would disappear (whether killed, held hostage, or something else, the community did not know). He thought Hope was a respectable young man and was pleased that he was Protestant. But soon after Ferrier decided to allow Lucy to marry the young man, the Mormon Prophet came to visit. The Prophet was the leader of the Mormon community, and he said that Lucy must choose to marry Joseph Stangerson or Enoch Drebber. Stangerson and Drebber both had many wives as polygamy was custom and they were both high ranking members in the Mormon community. Ferrier was appalled, but threatened. He knew that he could not disobey the Prophet and live to tell the tale, but he would never give his precious Lucy away to one of those terrible men. With only a month to prepare, he wrote a note to Jefferson Hope (who was away on a hunting trip), asking him to come back and help him and Lucy run away and start a new life. When Hope returned, the three stole away in the middle of night. They had gotten into the woods to make camp when Hope left to hunt down some food for them to eat before continuing on their journey. But when he returned, both Ferriers were gone. He frantically searched the campsite and found a grave that read "John Ferrier". Lucy Ferrier had been kidnapped and made a wife to Enoch Drebber. She died of a broken heart. Jefferson Hope was anguished and infuriated and he spent his entire life plotting revenge against the two men. When Drebber and Stangerson realized that their lives were in danger, they ran (across the United States, to St. Petersburgh, and finally to London) until Jefferson Hope caught up with them. He got a job as a taxi driver and kept an eye on them for weeks. Finally, one night when Stangerson was drunk, Hope picked him up and brought him back to Number 3, Lauriston Gardens. When they got inside, Hope revealed his identity and pulled two identical pills from his pocket. One was extremely deadly, and the other was harmless. Stangerson fearfully chose one at random- and he chose the wrong one, for he died almost on instant. Out of excitement, Jefferson Hope's nose began to bleed. So Hope took the blood and rubbed the word 'Rache' on the wall in an attempt to confuse the police. His rouse worked on everyone except for Sherlock Holmes. Next, Hope found Drebber and climbed in through his window. He woke the man up and gave him the option to take a pill, but Drebber sprang at Hope's throat, so Hope stabbed him in the heart. His justice had been served- both men were dead. Then, Jefferson Hope went back to his workplace, where his boss said that his cab was requested at 221B Baker Street. Suspecting no harm, Hope drove there and entered the building, in which Holmes attacked and handcuffed the culprit. The case was solved! Holmes inquired only one thing- who was the old woman who came to get the wedding ring? Hope refused to rat out any accomplices that he had as Detectives Gregson and Lestrade began to discuss Hope's trial, but the man just laughed. He knew all along that he was a dying man anyways. A couple days later, before the trial, Hope died from an aneurysm. He was found in his prison cell, with a peaceful smile spread across his face.
A SIGN OF THE FOUR
At the outset of the novel Doctor Watson states that he has been watching Holmes takes cocaine three times a day for many months. Watson's reluctance to oppose Holmes is finally overcome and he confronts his friend about the potential ill effects of this prolonged usage. However, Holmes explains that the drug stimulates and clarifies his mind and that, without work to challenge his mental faculties, he becomes bored with day-to-day life.
A young lady named Mary Morstan comes to consult Holmes upon a case which she assures him is very unusual. Her father, Captain Arthur Morstan, disappeared some years previously under suspicious circumstances. He had obtained twelve months leave from his Indian regiment and sent word to her to meet him at his hotel. Whilst the hotel confirmed that he was staying there they informed Miss Morstan that he had gone out and not returned. Inquiries at the time produced no result. Major Sholto was Morstan's only known friend in London, the two had been in the same regiment together. Sholto had retired from service at that time and claimed not to have even known that Morstan was in the country.
A few years after this disappearance an advertisement appeared in a paper asking for Miss Morstan to reveal her address. Upon the advice of her employer she did so and that same day she received a valuable pearl in the post. Since then she has received one pearl a year for the last six years.
Miss Morstan has now received a letter which urges her to meet with the sender that night. The anonymous sender permits her to bring two friends as long as they are not police. Later that night on their way to the rendezvous Miss Morstan tells Holmes that Sholto and her father were in charge of the convict guard at the Andaman Islands. She also shows Holmes a strange paper which was found among her father's things after he disappeared, the document appears to be a map and a sign with four crosses in a straight line with touching arms is present in the corner. Written below the sign are the words "The Sign of Four" along with three Indian names and one English name.
Holmes discovers that Major Sholto died about six years previously, within a week of the date of his passing Miss Morstan received her first pearl. This fact suggests that Sholto's heir knows how Captain Morstan died and wishes to make reparation to Miss Morstan.
Upon reaching the rendezvous Holmes, Watson and Miss Morstan are met by a coachman and conveyed to the home of Thaddeus Sholto. Thaddeus and his twin brother Bartholomew are the only children of the deceased Major Sholto, who eleven years previously had returned to England in possession of great wealth and settled in Upper Norwood. Thaddeus relates that his father was fearful of his personal safety and also seemed to have an aversion to men with wooden legs.
On his deathbed, Major Sholto told his sons that whilst in India he and Morstan came into possession of a large quantity of treasure. Sholto brought the wealth back to England with him and when Morstan returned he came immediately to Sholto's house to demand his share. The two men argued over the division of the treasure and Morstan suffered a fatal heart attack. Fearing that he would be implicated in the death, and that he would have to explain the story behind the treasure to the authorities, Sholto disposed of the body.
On his deathbed Major Sholto urged his sons to give Miss Morstan the half share of the treasure that should rightfully have been hers and explains that avarice kept him from doing so himself. Sholto was about to tell his sons the location of the treasure when he caught sight of a man at the window and died without imparting the whereabouts of the treasure.
The two brothers made every effort to find the treasure after their father's death but were not successful. Major Sholto had removed a chaplet to send to Miss Morstan before he died, Thaddeus proposed sending it to Miss Morstan but Bartholomew, inclined to his father's avarice, opposed the idea and so Thaddeus compromised by sending her one pearl a year. Bartholomew has now found the treasure and so Thaddeus has contacted Miss Morstan with the idea that together they will go and claim their respective shares.
Late that night the party arrive at Pondicherry Lodge and once within the house they discover that Bartholomew Sholto is dead, seemingly poisoned by a thorn lodged in his skin. A note reading "the sign of four" is found and the box of treasure has been stolen.
By an examination of the room Holmes determines that there were two people present when the treasure was removed. One was a wooden legged man and the other an extremely agile accomplice who shot a poisoned dart at Bartholomew Sholto. Athelney Jones of the official police force arrives, is dismissive of Holmes and arrests Thaddeus for the murder of Bartholomew. Holmes gives Jones a description of the real perpetrators including one man named Jonathan Small.
Holmes tells Watson that the explanation for the events is that Morstan and Sholto were informed by some convicts in the Andaman Islands of the existence of the treasure. The officers crossed the convicts in some way and Jonathan Small, one of the four, has now claimed the treasure for himself.
Holmes uses a dog named Toby to follow the scent of the men they seek, one of whom trod in creosote at the scene of the murder. He leads Holmes and Watson to a small wooden wharf, where he learns that Small hired a steam launch called the Aurora. Holmes engages his Baker Street Irregulars, a band of young boys from the streets who are given the task of finding the Aurora. Holmes and Watson conclude that Jonathan Small's companion is an Andaman Island aborigine.
A few days pass and no progress is made, Athelney Jones comes to Baker Street and tells Watson that he needs help from Holmes and that he had a message from the detective instructing him to go to Baker Street and wait. Watson explains that Holmes has gone out and is expected back later that day. Holmes enters disguised as an old mariner and is delighted when he is able to fool both of this friends with the device.
That night Holmes works with the police to pursue Jonathan Small. Holmes concludes that Small must have arranged that the Aurora be handed into a repair shop to hide it in case the trail was followed, via his disguise Holmes managed to locate the repair shop where the Aurora was kept and discover the time when it would be collected for use once more.
The Aurora is spotted and pursued, Jonathan Small is captured and his aboriginal companion is shot dead. An iron chest is found on the Aurora and presumed to contain the treasure but ultimately turns out to be empty. Jonathan Small. Small explains that he threw the treasure overboard since no one has a right to it save himself and three Indian men still in the Andaman convict barracks.
Small met the other men with whom he acquired the treasure when he was a guard in the city of Agra. One night two Sikh men who were under Small's command threatened his life. They told him that either he could join with them and be rich or that they would kill him. The two guards and a third man planned to bring a rich merchant to Agra and murder him for the wealth he would be carrying with him, Small agreed to assist. Once the merchant had been killed the men hid both the body and the treasure. An oath was sworn between them that they should always act for each other as much as themselves, the sign of four.
The plan went wrong and the four men were arrested for murder and sentenced to penal servitude for life. Small was transferred to the Andaman Islands. Small met Morstan and Sholto and offered them a deal, if they could secure freedom for him and his three companions then the officers would be cut in for an equal share of the wealth. An agreement was made and Sholto was assigned the task of verifying the treasure's location before helping the convicts to freedom. Sholto cheated them all by recovering the treasure alone and going back to England with it.
Small then saved the life of Tonga, an Andaman Islander, who consequently became very devoted to him. Tonga helped Small escape and the two wended their way to England together. Small received intelligence that the treasure had been discovered and planned his robbery with Tonga's help. Tonga killed Bartholomew Sholto, much to Small's rage since he wished no harm to the young man.
The case is wound up, Small is taken into custody and Watson becomes engaged to Mary Morstan. Since the official forces are receiving the credit for the case Watson asks what Holmes will get out of the affair into which he put so much work and effort. Holmes replies that he has cocaine and reaches for the bottle containing it.
A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA
Soon after his first marriage, Dr. John Watson leaves the Baker Street flat that he has shared with Sherlock Holmes and returns to private medical practice. In the course of his calls, he passes through Baker Street one day, sees Holmes pacing before the window, and on an impulse walks up to visit his friend. Holmes tells him that a client is expected that evening, one whose case may be interesting to Watson in his capacity as Holmes’s chronicler. The client arrives, a huge man, richly and garishly dressed and wearing a mask. Holmes quickly penetrates the disguise, however, and identifies the man as King Wilhelm of Bohemia. The surprised king unmasks and tells Holmes why he has come.
It seems that some years earlier, the king fell in love with a young soprano named Irene Adler. The woman is not only beautiful but also possessive. The king’s engagement to another woman, a princess, will soon be announced, and Irene Adler has sworn to stop the wedding. She threatens to publish a compromising photograph of her and the king, thereby creating a scandal that will lead the bride’s family to call off the wedding. She refuses to sell the photograph to the king; twice, burglars have failed to find it in her house; her luggage has been searched without success; and on two occasions robbers have stopped her, but without finding the picture. The king lays the matter in Holmes’s hands, begging for his help.
The next morning, Holmes disguises himself as a seedy-looking horse groom and goes to the neighborhood around Miss Adler’s house to see what gossip he can pick up. There he not only learns that Miss Adler has an admirer, Godfrey Norton, but also becomes involved in an incident that amuses as well as enlightens him. He sees both Norton and Miss Adler set off in separate carriages for a nearby church. When he follows them there, the disguised Holmes is commandeered as a witness for their wedding. Now that Irene Adler is married, Holmes expects her to leave London at any moment. He must therefore act, and do it swiftly.
On the following day, Holmes again disguises himself, this time as a clergyman, and requests Watson’s help for his scheme. They go to Adler’s house separately. Once there, Watson sees Miss Adler arrive, and she is immediately beset by a crowd of loafers. Holmes, in disguise, comes to her aid, is attacked and apparently wounded by the crowd, and falls to the ground. He is carried into Adler’s house and laid on a couch near a window where Watson can see him. On Holmes’s signal, Watson throws a smoke bomb through the window, and the people on the street outside begin to cry “Fire!” After the tumult that follows, Holmes joins Watson outside, and on their walk back to Baker Street, he explains what has happened.
Reasoning that Miss Adler had the photograph well hidden somewhere in her house and that she would immediately go to it in an emergency, Holmes stage-managed the little scene outside her house to see where she would run in such a case. The plan worked, and now he knows where the photograph is hidden. On the morrow he plans to go to the house with the king and take the photograph while Miss Adler is not in the room. As Watson and...
THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
Dr. Watson drops in on his friend Sherlock Holmes to find him in conversation with a man with fiery red hair, a Mr. Jabez Wilson. Wilson has come to Holmes with a problem concerning an organization for which he was working but that has mysteriously disappeared. Wilson owns a pawnshop but had for the last two months been employed part-time. At Holmes' urging, he tells his story.
Wilson's assistant Vincent Spaulding had pointed out to Wilson a job notice in the newspaper. It was a job sponsored by the Red-Headed League, and only men with red hair need apply. Spaulding convinced Wilson to go to the interview, and because of the bright color of his hair, Wilson was hired. His job was to copy the Encyclopedia Britannica from 10 A.M. until 2 P.M. He was not to leave the room at all, or he would lose his job. Wilson enjoyed the extra money he made but one Saturday, when he showed up at work, he saw a sign that said the League was dissolved. Wilson set out to discover what had happened to the League, and his well-paying job, but could learn nothing. Spaulding advised that he wait until the League got in touch with him, but Wilson came to seek the advice of Sherlock Holmes.
Holmes asks a few questions about Spaulding, finding out that he has been with Wilson for only three months, that he works for half the wages of anyone else, that he develops photographs in the pawnshop's cellar, and that he has a mark upon his forehead. Holmes gets excited at the last bit of information, and it seems that he recognizes Spaulding. Holmes then sends Wilson home, saying he will give him advice in a few days. After reflecting for an hour, Holmes, accompanied by Watson, goes to the square in which Wilson's shop is located. Holmes examines the neighborhood, thumps upon the pavement in front of the shop with his walkingstick, and then knocks on the door. A young man, presumably Spaulding, answers, and Holmes asks directions of him. However, he is most interested in observing the knees of the shop assistant's trousers; he sees there what he had expected to see. The two men then walk around the block to see what shops are behind Wilson's shop. There is a tobacco store, a newspaper store, a restaurant, a carriage-depot, and the City and Suburban Bank.
The two men attend a concert that afternoon. Afterwards, Holmes tells Watson that a serious crime is about to be committed and that he needs Watson's help that evening. Watson returns to Holmes' residence at ten that evening, where police agent Peter Jones, of the Scotland Yard, and Mr. Merryweather, of the City and Suburban Bank, are already gathered. Holmes explains that they are going to meet the master criminal John Clay this evening. The men take carriages to the bank and wait in the vault. Merryweather realizes that Clay is about to attempt to steal a large reserve of gold. The four men then quiet down and wait.
After more than an hour, one of the stones on the floor begins to move. John Clay emerges through the hole in the floor. He pulls his partner, a man with fiery red hair, up after him. Holmes springs out from his hiding place and uses his hunting crop to knock the gun out of Clay's hand. The accomplice has dashed back through the hole, but Holmes had warned Jones to put guards in front of Wilson's house, where the tunnel leads. Jones leads Clay outside to take him to the police station.
In the early hours of the morning, Holmes explains to Watson how he solved the crime. He realized immediately that Wilson's job copying the encyclopedia was simply a ruse to get him out of the pawnshop for several hours a day. Holmes figured that Spaulding, who spent so much time in the pawnshop's cellar, was digging a tunnel leading to a nearby building. By thumping his walkingstick on the pavement, Holmes determined Wilson's cellar stretched behind the house, so he walked around the block to see what businesses were there. When he saw a bank, the tunnel's destination was obvious. Holmes also looked at the knees of Spaulding's trousers to see that they were worn and stained from hours of digging out a tunnel. He knew Spaulding would rob the bank that evening, Saturday, because he would thus have an extra day before the robbery would be discovered and he could make his escape. After solving the problem mentally, Holmes called Jones and Merryweather to help catch the thieves.
Watson openly admires Holmes, but Holmes merely says that solving the case saved him from boredom, a boredom which is already beginning to settle on him again. He says that his life is simply an attempt to "escape from the commonplaces of existence." Watson points out that he helps people as well. Holmes agrees, noting that man himself is nothing, but that his work is everything.
A CASE OF IDENTITY
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s detective Sherlock Holmes appeared in fifty-six short stories and four full length novels. "A Case of Identity" is one of the lesser known stories in the series, possibly because the case does not focus on a major crime in the same way as the majority of the other tales do. "A Case of Identity" was first published in 1891 in Strand Magazine, a month after the publication of Conan Doyle’s better known story, "The Red Headed League". The following year it was included in the collection The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. In "A Case of Identity," Holmes does not deal with a robbery or a murder, as in earlier cases, but with the disappearance of his client, Mary Sutherland's fiancé. Holmes’ ever-present sidekick, Dr. Watson, does not know what to make of the case, but Holmes doesn't need to leave the confines of his flat at 221B Baker Street to solve it.
When Mary explains her situation to Holmes and Watson, they learn that she lives with her mother and her mother’s new husband, Mr. Windibank. Mary has an income of one hundred pound per year, the result of an inheritance from her Uncle Ned. This money she gives to her mother and stepfather so as not to be a burden on them. In spite of having poor eyesight, Mary is able to do typing work to earn a bit of extra money. Mary is unhappy that her mother has remarried the much younger Windibank. Windiband has amassed a considerable amount of money for Mary’s mother by selling her late husband’s business for her. He does not like to socialize and is upset when his wife wants to go to the gasfitters’ ball with Mary. At the time of the ball, he goes on a business trip to France. At the ball, Mary meets Mr. Hosmer Angel and within a short time they become engaged. Mary and her mother do not tell Mr. Windibank of the engagnment.
When Windibank returns from France, Mary and Hosmer decide that they will communicate with each other via letter, rather than in person. While Hosmer types his letters, he requests that Mary make hers more romantic by writing them by hand. Mary knows little about Hosmer. She does not know where he works or lives. The letters she sends him are addressed to the Leadenball Street Post Office, where he picks them up. Being a shy man, Hosmer likes to walk with Mary by night, rather than by day. His voice is weak as the result of a childhood illness. He wears tinted glasses because his eyes are sensitive to light. When Windibank returns to France on business, Hosmer convinces Mary to marry him before her stepfather returns. He makes her promise that she will always be true to him, regardless of anything that might happen. Her mother agrees to Mary making this promise to Hosmer.
Mary does not believe she needs her stepfather’s permission to get married, but she still feels uncomfortable doing so without his knowledge. Hosmer tells Mary and her mother not to worry about Windibank, but he does write to him. The letter is returned by the post office. Mary sees this as an indication that Windibank left before the letter reached him and is on his way back to England. A small wedding is planned and Hosmer arrives in a Hansom cab to bring Mary and her mother to the church. Once again, he insists that Mary vow to remain true to him no matter what. Hosmer takes a separate cab to the church because there is not enough room in the Hansom. Later, when Hosmer's cab arrives at the church, it is empty, and the driver can offer no explanation, as he had seen Hosmer get on board.
Mary defends Hosmer to Holmes, even though Holmes points out how shabbily he has treated Mary. She fears that he has been in some sort of accident and is sure he will be in touch as soon as he is able to. She thinks he must have felt that something bad might happen, which is why he made her promise to remain true to him. In response to Holmes’ questions about other people’s reactions to Hosmer's disappearance, Mary says that her mother is too angry to discuss the situation, while her stepfather agrees that something unfortunate must have happened to Hosmer and that Mary will hear from him in time. Holmes tells Mary that she should forget about Hosmer as she will never see him again. When she presses him for more information, Holmes asks Mary for the typed letters Hosmer sent her and for a description of him. He also takes note of Mary’s address, which is the same as Windibank’s, and the name of the company Windibank works for. As Mary takes her leave, Holmes reminds her to forget about Hosmer, but she continues to pledge her allegiance to him.
Holmes writes a letter to Winidbank and receives a response typed on the same machine as Hosmer’s letters. This confirms what Holmes already knows, that Windibank and Hosmer are the same person, which explains why they are never in the same room at the same time. Windibank, in disguise and taking advantage of Mary’s poor eyesight, pretended to be Hosmer to engage Mary in a love affair which would never enfd in marriage. All of this was designed to help Windibank and Mary’s mother retain the one hundred pounds per year they receive from Mary's inheritance. Holmes chooses not to tell Mary the outcome of the situation, beliving Windibank will follow a path that will ultimately lead him to the gallows.
THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
When Sherlock Holmes receives an urgent plea for help from a young woman, Alice Turner, he interrupts Dr. Watson's holiday and they set off. Alice wants Holmes to exonerate her childhood friend James McCarthy, whom she loves dearly and who has been charged with murdering his father, William McCarthy. She is convinced of his innocence and believes the murder charge is due in part to his refusal to reveal what he and his father were arguing about the day the elder McCarthy was killed. They were in fact arguing about James' refusal to marry her. After interviewing him, Holmes also believes him to be innocent. The solution to the crime is to be found in events that began long ago when the elder McCarthy and Alice's father, John Turner, both lived in Australia.
THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS
John Openshaw visits Holmes to ask for help about a certain mysterious and threatening kind of letter both his uncle and father had received just before their deaths. His uncle, Elias, had emigrated to America in his youth and became a planter in Florida. Since returning, he had taken part in raising John.
One day, when he received a letter with nothing but five orange pips in the envelope and the letters "K. K. K." written on the inside flap, he burned a box of papers and made his will to Joseph, his brother, and John's father. Shortly after, he was found dead in what appeared to be an accident; a similar incident befell Joseph, who received a letter and then died under suspicious circumstances.
Holmes advises John, who has himself just received the foreboding pips, to offer up the box of documents. However, the next day John is discovered dead. Holmes deduces that it is the Ku Klux Klan and that the ringleader of the murders has been traveling around on a ship; after determining the identity of the vessel that this James Calhoun has left London on, Holmes sends a letter of his own to the authorities there to encourage Calhoun's arrest.
The story ends in mystery though, as the ship sinks in mysterious circumstances.
THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
At the behest of one of his wife's friends, Watson goes to Upper Swandam Lane, a notorious neighborhood, to look for the friend's husband in an opium den. After finding the man, Watson runs into Holmes in disguise, who explains that he is working a case on the disappearance of a man named Neville St. Clair.
Mrs. St. Clair had explained to Holmes that she unexpectedly saw her husband in the window of the opium den and that when she went in to look for him, he had disappeared. All that were left in the room with Hugh Boone, a professional beggar, were Mr. St. Clair's clothes. Boone is imprisoned on suspicion of having had something to do with St. Clair's disappearance.
Holmes, however, deduces that Boone is in fact St. Clair in disguise, which he proves by wiping the stage cosmetics from Boone's face in the prison. St. Clair/Boone explains that he figured out he could make a solid living by begging in disguise but does not want his wife to find out. Holmes makes him swear not to do so again.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
Peterson, a commissioner, brings to Holmes a hat that was left by a man, along with a Christmas goose, who ran away when Peterson rushed over to try to save him from a fight. Holmes at first tries to deduce for whom the goose was intended, but Peterson returns with the discovery in the goose's crop of a famous jewel, the blue carbuncle owned by the Countess of Morcar, which was recently reported as stolen. John Horner, a plumber who was at the Hotel Cosmopolitan, the hotel where the Countess was staying at the time of the theft, was accused of the crime, but Holmes suspects someone else.
Holmes traces the path of the goose back to its source, beginning with the Alpha Inn, where it was sold. He then goes to Mr. Breckinridge, a salesman, from whom he learns the goose came from Mrs. Oakshott. Visiting Mrs. Oakshott, Holmes comes across James Ryder, the head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan, who stole the carbuncle after hearing of it from Catherine Cusack, the Countess' maid. After the theft, Ryder had struggled for an idea to conceal the carbuncle, lest it were found it his person; but his idea of stuffing it down a goose's crop backfired when he lost track of the goose.
Holmes lets the man go.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
Helen Stoner begs Holmes for help with a strange situation that gives her cause to fear for her own life at her stepfather's house at Stoke Moran. Her stepfather, Dr. Grimesby Roylott, had married Helen's mother in India and gained from her a substantial amount of money before her death, after which he moved with Helen and her twin sister Julia to his ancestral home and gave the two girls little opportunity to enjoy the society of others.
Not long after Julia announced her engagement, Helen was awoken in the middle of the night by a strange whistle and a clanging of metal, and then she saw Julia in a terrified state crying something about a "speckled band." By an unknown cause, Julia then died.
Helen had just become engaged herself and fears that she will meet a similar fate. Holmes hides with Watson in Julia's former room, where Dr. Roylott had made Helen move, and then, when he hears the strange whistle, beats at something in a metal grate above the bed. He and Watson then go to Dr. Roylott's room where they find him dead of the poisonous bite of the speckled band, a snake Dr. Roylott had brought from India.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
Watson treats Victor Hatherley, a hydraulic engineer, who has lost a thumb. Hatherley explains to Watson, who brings him to Holmes, the strange circumstances under which he received his injury.
He was approached by a certain Colonel Lysander Stark with a lucrative but oddly secretive deal to inspect a hydraulic press in a house. After repairing the press, Hatherley asked the Colonel the nature of its use, at which point the Colonel locked him in the press and turned it on.
Hatherley escaped with the help of a woman in the house, but while in the process of lowering himself from a window, the Colonel chopped off his thumb. Hatherley made it away from the house to some bushes where he fainted. When he came to, he was alone.
Holmes, Watson, and Hatherley find their way to the house, whose location Holmes has deduced, and they find it up in flames. Holmes realizes this was due to Hatherley's lamp being in the press at the time the Colonel tried to shut it on him. Unfortunately, the so-called Colonel, who was manufacturing counterfeit coins, has already escaped.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
Lord Robert Saint-Simon, the son of a duke and therefore a personage of high rank, comes to visit Holmes for aid in a matter that the latter has already read about with Watson. At breakfast the day of Saint-Simon's wedding, his wife-to-be, Hatty Doran, an American, left the table and then disappeared. Holmes learns a few additional details from Saint-Simon, including an incident in which Doran dropped her bouquet and a gentleman in the pews restored it to her. With this and a handwritten note given him by Inspector Lastrade soon after, Holmes deduces the truth of the case.
He organizes a meeting at which Lord Saint-Simon is introduced to Hatty Doran, now revealed as Mrs. Francis Hay Multon, and Francis Hay Multon himself. Hatty explains that years ago she was married in secret to Frank but then came to England and eventually agreed to be married to Lord Saint-Simon after news that Frank had been killed in an Apache raid. However, she saw Frank in the pews and by dropping her bouquet near him managed to inconspicuously pick up a note from him asking her to elope. The two had planned to leave London in secret, but Holmes, having solved the case, tracked them down and convinced them to explain their case in public.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
Alexander Holder, a banker, comes to Holmes to ask for help in locating the Beryl Coronet, a precious piece of jewelry that was entrusted to him by a member of the British high nobility as collateral for a loan. On a previous night, Holder woke up to find his son Arthur holding a broken portion of the coronet and so assumes the latter's guilt. However, Holmes doubts that Arthur was the culprit.
By examining Holder's house and its environs, and interviewing his niece Mary, Holmes discovers that it was in fact she who had, under the influence of her lover the notorious Sir George Burnwell, stolen the coronet. Holmes tracks down and confronts Burnwell and secures the return of the jewels, which he gives to Holder.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
Violet Hunter, a governess, comes to Holmes to tell him her misgivings about a job she is about to take. Although it is highly lucrative, she senses something off about Jephro Rucastle, her future employer. Some time after starting at The Copper Beeches, Hunter telegrams Holmes asking for his help. She explains that Rucastle has made her cut her hair and sit in a blue dress with the back of her head to a window for some time each day.
One day, with a hidden mirror, she discerns a man on the road by the house looking at her. When Mr. Rucastle and his wife notice this, they begin to abuse her. One night, Hunter tries to go into a room and is threatened by Mr. Rucastle, who says he will feed her to the family's mastiff.
Holmes reasons that Mr. Rucastle has imprisoned his daughter Alice Rucastle in that room; and so he and Watson sneak into the house to try to free her. However, Mr. Rucastle has already taken his daughter away. When he runs away from a confrontation with them, he inadvertently runs into the hound, who grievously mauls him.
Holmes hears the full story from Mrs. Toller, one of the house maids. Mr. Rucastle, in order to hold onto Alice's inheritance from her late mother, had tried to prevent her from marrying Mr. Foster, a man she loved. With the case solved, Alice is able to marry.
SILVER BLAZE
Silver Blaze was the favorite. And a beautiful piece of horseflesh she was. Colonel Ross was expecting a lot from this wonderful animal on Derby Day. And then came despair. Early in the morning the stable-boy is aroused from a deep sleep caused by a drug, to find Silver Blaze gone, and the jockey, Shraker, dead, with a crushed skull, in the open field nearby. Sherlock Holmes had first-hand information of this case since he was at the home of his old friend Ross, when the Colonel's beautiful horse disappeared. An investigation by the great detective gives him a sure clue to the whereabouts of the animal and he acts promptly. Colonel Ross insists that he must withdraw the favorite from the race program, but Holmes says, "No!" and his command is emphatic. Rather bewildered but trusting the wisdom of his old friend, Colonel Ross goes to the track on Derby Day, but is dismayed when he can find no trace of good old "Silver Blaze." But Holmes bids him wait and insists that his horse will come through a sure winner, despite his apparent mysterious absence. The race is finished and the winner comes to the Stables, and here to the nervous and astonished Colonel Ross, a little water and a soft cloth remove from the forehead of the winner a dark stain which had covered up the great blazing white mark which had given the beautiful animal the name of "Silver Blaze." Holmes' investigation had trailed the Derby favorite to the home of trainer Brown and he forced Brown to admit having the horse. The jockey, Shraker, had attempted to steal the animal and had drugged the stable boy, but he was thrown and kicked by the racer and so his villainous plans were suddenly halted. Brown found "Silver Blaze" in the open field and thought to make him unrecognizable by painting over the great white "blaze," but he had not calculated on the genius of Sherlock Holmes.
THE YELLOW FACE
The story begins with Holmes and Watson out for a walk on an early spring day. When they return, they find that a client has come and gone in their absence, leaving behind only his pipe. Holmes makes several rapid deductions about the man based upon the pipe, all of which prove to be correct. The man, one Grant Munro, returns in a high state of agitation, requesting Holmes’ professional aid and advice. Munro breaks into a rather lengthy explanation of his problem, which concern the mysterious actions of his wife, Effie. Munro explains that his wife was a widow, whose husband and child had died in America from the yellow fever. After being married happily for three years, Munro’s wife had come asking him for money. He gave it to her, but never learned for what it was used.
A short time later, an empty house near the Munro’s was tenanted, and passing by the place one day, Grant had seen a hideous yellow face in the window. Not long after that, Munro had been awakened by Effie leaving the house in the middle of the night, only to return in a high state of excitement and worry. The next day, passing by the mysterious house again, Grant had witnessed his wife hurrying away from the place. The man had attempted to go in, but was restrained by Effie. She had refused to explain what was going on, but had asked Grant to trust her, which the man had relented to do. Some days afterwards however, having learned that his wife had frequented the house again, Munro had broken into the house and searched it, finding nothing of consequence except a large photo of Effie.
After Grant’s narrative, Holmes questions him, particularly about the face in the window. Munro describes it as “hideous” and “unnatural.” Holmes promises to look into the matter, and Grant leaves. Holmes explains to Watson that he believes Effie’s first husband is still alive, and is somehow blackmailing her. The two journey that night to Norbury, the town where the Munro’s live.
Accompanied by Grant, they break into the mysterious house, despite the objections of Effie and a strange woman who lives in the house. Charging upstairs, the three find a child with a hideous yellow face. Reaching forward, Holmes removes what proves to be a mask from the child’s face, revealing a little Negro girl. Effie explains that her husband in America was in fact a Negro, and that she hid her child away, making her wear the yellow mask to keep the neighbors from gossiping. Effie claims that she acted as she did for fear of how her husband would respond. After a long pause, the man scoops up the little girl, Lucy, stating: “I am not a very good man, Effie, but I think I am a better one than you have given me credit for being.”
Holmes and Watson quietly depart, and Holmes, realizing he was wrong in his deductions, advises Watson that if he (Sherlock) should ever become too overconfident in his own ability to simply whisper “Norbury” in his ear.
THE STOCK-BROKER'S CLERK
A young clerk, Hall Pycroft, consults Holmes with his suspicions concerning a company that has offered him a very well-paid job. Holmes, Watson and Pycroft travel by train to Birmingham, where the job is initially to be based, and Pycroft explains that he was recently made redundant from a stockbroking house. He eventually secured a new post with another stockbrokers, Mawson and Williams, in Lombard Street in the City. Before taking up the job, he was approached by Arthur Pinner, who offered him a managership with a newly established hardware distribution company, to be based in France. Pycroft is sent to Birmingham to meet Pinner's brother and company co-founder, Harry Pinner. He is offered a very well-paid post with one hundred pounds in advance, and is asked to sign a document accepting the post, and is also asked not to send a letter of resignation to his would-be employers — ones who allegedly bet Pinner that he would reject Pycroft's offer, Pinner betting in response that they wouldn't hear from Pycroft again. He immediately commences his duties, but he is concerned about the unprofessional aspects of the business and their sparse offices, as well as the suspicious fact that the two Pinners have a distinctive gold filling in their teeth in the same place, suggesting that they might be the same man.
When the trio arrive at the Birmingham office, with Holmes and Watson presented as fellow job-seekers, Pinner is reading a London newspaper and is clearly in shock. As they leave, he attempts suicide, but Watson is able to revive him. Holmes concludes that the story of the brothers is a fabrication and that there is only one 'Pinner'; lacking enough men to make their attempt to deceive Pycroft convincing, Pinner had attempted to pose as his brother to make up the numbers in the hope that Pycroft would dismiss the similarities between them as a family resemblance. He further deduces that the whole point of the exercise was to obtain Pycroft's signature so that a 'fake' Pycroft may be employed at Mawsons; hence why they asked him to not officially resign his post. Mawsons was keeping a vast stock of valuable securities, and 'Pycroft' was to be a safebreaker.
From the newspaper, they learn that Mawson & Williams have suffered an attempted robbery, but that the criminal had been captured, although the weekend watchman has been murdered. Beddington, the forger and cracksman, was the miscreant, masquerading as Pycroft, and his brother was masquerading as Pinner. Nearly a hundred thousand pounds' worth of American railway bonds, with a large amount of scrip in mines and other companies, was taken, but recovered by the police from the would-be thief.
As the police are called to arrest 'Pinner', Holmes observes that "Human nature is a strange mixture, Watson. You see that even a villain and murderer can inspire such affection that his brother turns to suicide when he learns that his neck is forfeited".
THE %GLORIA SCOTT%
Sherlock Holmes tells Watson his very first case when he was still a student. He was invited by his friend Victor Trevor for a month vacation in his father's house in Donnithorpe, Norfolk. At the end of the sojourn, an old and strange acquaintance of old Trevor named Hudson comes for a visit, but Holmes has to return to London. Two months later, Victor implored him to come back. Hudson seemed to have a very bad influence on old Trevor. His health was so bad that he died when Holmes arrived. Before dying the father told his son he wrote the story of what happened in his earlier life which would explain the current situation. In fact, Trevor's real name was Armitage. In 1885 when he was 23, he robbed a bank and was arrested and sent on board the Gloria Scott bound to Australia. During the trip, all the convicts organized a mutiny and took control of the boat, killing a lot of warders and sailors. Some of the mutineers including Trevor decided to quit the boat on a small barque as they didn't want to kill more than needed. The others stayed on the Gloria Scott and killed the remaining witnesses. A few minutes later the Gloria Scott was blown off by a big explosion. Only one survived, the sailor Hudson, who was pulled aboard the Trevor's barque. They were later saved by the brig Hotspur, bound for Australia. Trevor became rich with the diggings and he came back to England. Hudson was blackmailing the survivors... When Trevor died Hudson went to Beddoes' house but both disappeared. Holmes thinks Beddoes killed Hudson and flew from the country.
THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL
Holmes tells Watson one of his first investigations : a school friend, Reginald Musgrave, explains the problems he has with his butler, Brunton. Reginald caught him digging through the private papers of the family and with the ancestral ritual of the Musgraves in his hands, considered however worthless by the Musgraves. A few days after this incident, Brunton disappeared, as well as Rachel Howells, a maid. The lake of the property was dredged, but only a bag containing disparate objects was found. Holmes discovers that the ritual is a code to designate a specific place. It was here that he found Brunton's corpse, in a hole closed by a huge slab of the cellar. Brunton had deciphered the ritual and discovered the hidden treasure in the hole. But his accomplice, the maid, dropped the heavy slab above him once she got the recovered treasure. She threw the bag in the lake and fled the estate. She had done so in revenge for Brunton who had promised him marriage and had subsequently broken up for another woman. The treasure proved to be the former crown of England, entrusted to the Musgrave after the execution of Charles I
THE REIGATE SQUIRES
Sherlock Holmes had earned a few days vacation after the arrest of Europe's greatest scoundrel. Watson suggested that he spend a week at the home of a quiet, single friend, Colonel Hayter at Reigate. When they arrived in Surrey they learn that a gang of burglars are raging in the area. Poor old Mr. Acton has already suffered the effects, but fortunately the thieves have not taken anything of value. Holmes' convalescence doesn't last long because William Kirwan, the Cunningham's coachman, was found murdered. The Cunninghams testify that they saw the murderer flee and that he must be one of the local burglars. However, the evidence that Holmes is gathering shows another story. The burglars of the old Acton were the Cunninghams, who tried to grab an important piece of paper concerning a dispute between the two families. Kirwan had seen everything and wanted to blackmail his masters. Not a good idea because the Cunninghams arranged for him never to speak again. They betrayed each other by trying to strangle Holmes, who had laid his hands on a crucial clue incriminating them, and were arrested by Inspector Forrester.
THE CROOKED MAN
Holmes goes to Watson's house and tells him about the case he's working on. It is the murder of Colonel Barclay, commander of the Royal Mallows Regiment in Aldershot. Two days before, Mrs. Barclay had come home and had a fight with her husband. The servants, who were listening to the quarrel through the door of the small living room, heard a scream and then Fe silence. The driver tried to enter, but the door was closed from the inside, so he decided to go around the garden and came into the room through a French window. He discovered the colonel's body lying on the ground, stiff dead, and Mrs. Barclay passed out on the couch. His first reflex was to open the door to other servants, but the key was not on the door and could not be found. However, a club was found near the body and Mrs. Barclay was immediately suspected by the police. Holmes examined the house the next day and found the prints of an unknown man and a strange creature. He deduced that the colonel was killed by the stranger, who took the key with him, or that the colonel fainted with surprise when he saw the man and died when his head hit the chimney tracks. Miss Morrison tells Holmes that on the night of the tragedy she had met a stranger she did not know but who seemed familiar to Mrs. Barclay. Holmes interviewed the man, Henry Wood, who had been a corporal in the same regiment as Colonel Barclay twenty years earlier. Both were rivals and coveted the same woman, Miss Nancy Devoy, the current Mrs. Barclay. During the Cipay revolt, when Wood volunteered to seek reinforcements across enemy lines, Barclay, then sergeant, advised him the way to go. Betrayed by Barclay, Wood fell into a trap and was imprisoned for years, suffering cruel abuse that made him deformed. Fortunately, he managed to escape and returned to England. When he met Mrs. Barclay in Aldershot, he told her about his sad adventure. Mrs. Barclay asked her husband for explanations and argued with him. When Wood appeared in the small living room the colonel fainted under the effect of surprise and killed himself in the fall. The strange animal, Wood's companion, was a mongoose.
THE RESIDENT PATIENT
Dr. Percy Trevelyan seeks Sherlock Holmes' assistance in deciphering his benefactor's recent odd behavior. Trevelyan recounts that some years before, Mr. Blessington plucked him out of an obscure and virtually non-existent practice and offered to set him up at a prestigious address. In return for this investment, Blessington would receive a percentage of his income and would provide him with free medical care. For quite some time now the arrangement has worked well for both parties and Blessington has profited from the arrangement. Recently however, Blessington has been acting very strangely. Having read of a burglary in a nearby home, Blessington was overwrought and had bars installed on all the windows. Holmes is intrigued by the case but subsequent events soon have him investigating a murder.
THE GREEK INTERPRETER
Dr. Watson is shocked to learn that his good friend Sherlock Holmes has a brother, Mycroft, and that they are on their way to meet him on an urgent matter. There they learn of the strange case of Mr. Melas, a Greek interpreter, who was roused from his sleep in the middle of the night and required to interpret for a man who was clearly being held against his will. That man was beaten, bound and not allowed to speak but only to write out his answers to the questions he was posed. Clearly his captors are trying to force him to sign a document and are also keeping his sister captive. When Melas is taken a second time to interpret, Holmes, Mycroft and Watson must move quickly if they are to prevent a murder.
THE NAVAL TREATY
When Dr. Watson receives a plea for help from an old school friend, Sherlock Holmes finds himself dealing a most baffling case. Percy Phelps is an officer at the Foreign Office and nine weeks previously had been tasked by Lord Holdhurst, one of the most senior men in the Foreign Office and Percy's uncle, to copy a naval treaty the British government recently negotiated with the Italians. The document is highly sensitive and the French and Germans would pay a high price for a copy. To his horror, the document was taken from his desk when Percy left the room momentarily. Since that time he has been convalescing at the home of his fiancée, Annie Harrison, a broken man who has nearly gone out of his mind with worry.
THE FINAL PROBLEM
Holmes arrives at Dr. John Watson's residence one evening in a somewhat agitated state and with grazed and bleeding knuckles. Much to Watson's surprise and horror, Holmes had apparently escaped three separate murder attempts that day after a visit from Professor Moriarty, who warned Holmes to withdraw from his pursuit of justice against him to avoid any regrettable outcome. First, just as Holmes was turning a street corner, a cab suddenly rushed toward him and he just managed to leap out of the way in time. Second, while Holmes was walking along the street, a brick fell from the roof of a house, just missing the detective. He then called the police to search the whole area but could not prove that it was anything other than an accident. Finally, on his way to Watson's house, Holmes was attacked by a thug armed with a cosh. Holmes managed to overcome his assailant and handed him to the police but admitted that there was virtually no hope of proving that the man was in the employ of the criminal mastermind.
Holmes has been tracking Moriarty and his agents for months and is on the brink of snaring them all and delivering them to the dock. Moriarty is the criminal genius behind a highly organised and extremely secret criminal force and Holmes will consider it the crowning achievement of his career if he can defeat Moriarty. Moriarty is out to thwart Holmes's plans and is well capable of doing so, for he is, as Holmes admits, the great detective's intellectual equal.
Holmes asks Watson to come to the continent with him, giving him unusual instructions designed to hide his tracks to the boat train at Victoria station. Holmes is not quite sure where they will go, which seems rather odd to Watson. Holmes, certain that he has been followed to his friend's house, then makes off by climbing over the back wall in the garden. The next day Watson follows Holmes's instructions to the letter and finds himself waiting in the reserved first-class coach for his friend, but only an elderly Italian priest is there. The cleric soon makes it apparent that he is, in fact, Holmes in disguise.
As the boat train pulls out of Victoria, Holmes spots Moriarty on the platform, making gestures in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the train. Holmes is forced to take action as Moriarty has obviously tracked Watson, despite extraordinary precautions. Holmes and Watson alight at Canterbury, making a change to their planned route. As they are waiting for another train to Newhaven a special one-coach train roars through Canterbury, as Holmes suspected it would. It contains the professor, who has hired the train in an effort to overtake Holmes. Holmes and Watson are forced to hide behind luggage.
Having made their way to Strasbourg via Brussels, the following Monday Holmes receives a message that most of Moriarty's gang have been arrested in England and recommends Watson return there now, as the detective will likely prove to be a very dangerous companion. Watson, however, decides to stay with his friend. Moriarty himself has slipped out of the grasp of the English police and is obviously with them on the continent.
Holmes and Watson's journey takes them to Switzerland where they stay at Meiringen. From there they fatefully decide to take a walk which will include a visit to the Reichenbach Falls, a local natural wonder. Once there, a boy appears and hands Watson a letter, saying that there is a sick Englishwoman back at the hotel who wants an English doctor. Holmes realises at once it is a hoax although he does not say so. Watson goes to see about the patient, leaving Holmes by himself.
Upon returning to the Englischer Hof, Watson finds that the innkeeper has no knowledge of any sick Englishwoman. Realising at last that he has been deceived, he rushes back to the Reichenbach Falls but finds no one there, although he does see two sets of footprints going out onto the muddy dead end path with none returning. There is also a note from Holmes, explaining that he knew the report Watson was given to be a hoax and that he is about to fight Moriarty, who has graciously given him enough time to pen this last letter. Watson sees that towards the end of the path there are signs that a violent struggle has taken place and there are no returning footprints. It is all too clear Holmes and Moriarty have both fallen to their deaths down the gorge while locked in mortal combat. Saddened, Dr. Watson returns to England. The Moriarty gang are all convicted on the strength of evidence secured by Holmes. Watson ends his narrative by saying that Sherlock Holmes was the best and the wisest man he had ever known.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE
Ronald Adair was found murdered in his home on Park Lane. He's been shot in a closed room, with no possible exit through the windows. Adair was a quiet young man. His only hobby was playing cards, and just had won £240 with his new partner, Colonel Sebastian Moran.
The crime being very mysterious, Watson tries to apply Holmes's methods to get at the truth, but to no avail. One day, as he's examining the area around Adair's house, he bumps into an old man who eventually follows him to his office.
There, the old man drops his disguise, revealing himself to be Holmes. Watson is very shocked to see Holmes alive as he thought he was dead (see The Adventure of the Final Problem). Holmes then explains that he never fell at Reichenbach, but took advantage of his "official death" to track down Moriarty's accomplices around the world. He came back to London when he heard about the Adair case because Moran was Moriarty's lieutenant, and has been cunning enough to escape police thus far. The detective knows Moran is aware he came back and intends to kill him.
Holmes takes his friend to an empty house from where they can see the windows of 221B Baker Street. Watson wonders how he can see Holmes's profile through the window, and the detective explains it's a wax bust he is using as a decoy. While Holmes and Watson wait, Moran enters the room without seeing the two men hiding in the dark and shoots the bust. Watson knocks him down as Holmes calls Lestrade to arrest him. The detective explains to Lestrade that Moran also killed Adair, who had caught him cheating at card and threatened to denounce him.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER
One morning, as Holmes is complaining to Watson (who had moved back to Baker Street few month ago) about the lack of interesting criminal case since the death of Moriarty, a panic-stricken young solicitor called John McFarlane burst in the room, certain that he is about to be arrested for the murder of Jonas Oldacre, a builder in Lower Norwood.
Oldacre is a wealthy 52-year-old bachelor that McFarlane hadn’t met until the day before, when he came to the law office to announce that he intended to make him heir to a considerable bequest, having heard high praise of the young man. Oldacre invites McFarlane home on the same night to seal the deal.
The next day, Oldacre is missing and burnt remains were found after a fire in a wood pile behind his house. Signs of a struggle, scattered papers and McFarlane's walking stick were found in his home.
Lestrade, who arrived in 221B Baker street in the meantime, arrests the young man; Holmes, who noticed that Oldacre's will seems to have been written carelessly on a train, states he's heading to Blackheath, where McFarlane's parents are living. He learns that Oldacre and McFarlane's mother were engaged years earlier but she broke it off. Continuing to Norwood, he examined the builder's house but found nothing that could exonerate the lawyer. He did, however, find a "curious little point" in Oldacre's papers: lately, several cheques for substantial amounts had been made out to a Mr. Cornelius. The next day, Holmes and Watson head back to Norwood, asked here by Lestrade who shows them new evidence against McFarlane: his bloody thumbprint on the wall. Holmes, who had examined the wall the day before and was certain the print hadn't been there, then, understands that Oldacre is still in the house and starts a fire to bring him out of hiding.
Oldacre claims it had all been a practical joke, but Holmes explains to Lestrade he acted out of revenge toward the woman who rejected him and had intended to start a new life under the name of Cornelius.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN
Mr Hilton Cubbit, from Riding Thorpe Manor, in Norfolk, had married Elsie a year ago. Elsie, a young American woman, had warned her husband that her past held dark secrets which she could not share with him. Lately, he had been finding a series of apparently meaningless signs showing little dancing men drawn with a chalk or on a paper about their property. When he showed them to his wife, she was so terror-stricken that she fainted. Not able to involve the police without breaking his promise to his wife not to inquire about her past, Cubbit contacts Holmes to solve this mystery. The detective accepts and asks Cubbit to send him every sample of dancing men he gets. When Holmes succeeds in deciphering the code, he decides to rush to Norfolk with Watson but, once they arrive, they learn that Cubbit has been shot dead and his wife has been injured. As it happened when they were alone in a closed room, Elsie is considered guilty of a murder-suicide. With Inspector Martin in attendance, Holmes spots an unaccounted for bullet hole and deduces that someone else was there at the time of the murder. He then sends a stable boy to a place named Elridge's to deliver a note consisting of a series of dancing men to a certain Abe Slaney. He also explains to Watson and Martin how he deciphered the code and was able to identify Slaney as a dangerous criminal from Chicago. When Slaney arrives, he's arrested but falls apart when he learns Elsie is injured. He confesses she is actually the daughter of the leader of the American criminal gang who created the code and used to be engaged to Slaney. She ran away to London, but Slaney found and threatened her with the coded messages. She finally summoned him to her house to beg him to leave her alone. As they were arguing, Cubbit saw them and shot, but Slaney returned fire and killed him. Elsie, upset, tried to kill herself but failed.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST
In april 1895, Holmes is contacted by a beautiful young music teacher named Violet Smith who lives near Farnham in Surrey. She's worried about a stranger who stalks her when she bicycles to and from the train station when she goes to see her fiancé in London each weekend. This man appears and disappears mysteriously. Violet Smith and her mother were living in poverty until few months ago, when two friends of her uncle Ralph Smith from South Africa, came to announce that he asked them to take care of his closest relatives. One the two men, Carruthers, is affable. He offers Violet an excellent wage to live in his house and teach music to his daughter, and he seems to grow fond of the young woman. The other one, Woodley, is rough and makes unwanted advances. Watson, asked by Holmes to visit Farnham and collect information, figures out that the stalking cyclist disappears by hiding in a hedge along the property of Mr. Williamson, a defrocked clergyman, whose residence is known as a place of debauchery, regularly visited by Woodley. The next day, Holmes gets a letter from Violet Smith informing him that she's about to leave Carruthers's home to live permanently in London. She feels too uncomfortable since she had to turn down Carruthers's proposal, and since Woodley, who had been thrown out, has returned as rude as ever. Holmes and Watson, worried, rush to Farnham, where they catch the mysterious cyclist, who turns out to be Carruthers, who is trying to protect Violet. The three men unfortunately arrive too late to stop Violet's abduction. When they find her, she's been forcibly married to Woodley by Williamson. Holmes, who has no doubt this marriage can be annulled, explains that Carruthers and Woodley came back from South Africa to try to get Violet to marry one of them, as her uncle was about to die and she was going to inherit a fortune from him. The two men would then share the money. But Carruthers's blossoming love for Violet estranged the two accomplices and Woodley resorted to criminal action with the help of Williamson.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL
Thorneycroft Huxtable, the founder and director of the very select Priory School, contacts Holmes for help: One of his students, the young Lord Saltire, son of the very rich and powerful Duke of Holdernesse, is missing.
The child, who had been living with his father, hadn't been happy. He had been longing for his mother, who had left home. He had received a letter from his father the day before his disappearance that he took with him. The boys in the next room hadn’t heard any noise, and the young Lord’s window had been found open.
Kidnapping suspicions have focused on Herr Heidegger, the German master, who disappeared from the school, along with his bicycle, on the same day.
Holmes and Watson head to the Duke's castle in Mackleton, and learn that the Duke's secretary, James Wilder, had posted the letter. As he examines a map, the detective also deduces the child and his kidnapper must have fled through the moor. Inspecting the marsh, Holmes and Watson find two sets of tire prints in two different places, one set of which was made by Heidegger’s bicycle. They also discover the teacher’s body, killed by a blow to the head.
They reach an isolated inn, run by Reuben Hayes, and Holmes figures out that the child has been taken and kept here. His deduction is reinforced when he sees Wilder rushing to this inn on a bike.
The detective then visits the Duke and accuses him of having planned his own child’s abduction. But Holdernesse denies that, confessing that he only covered Wilder's misdeeds, because the secretary is actually his illegitimate son. The young man is doing everything he can to ruin his father’s life and blackmail the Duke into leaving him the fortune. He trapped his hated half-brother by slipping a note in the letter he posted, asking him to meet his mother outside the school. When he saw the boy leave, Heidegger rushed behind to protect him, but was killed by Hayes who was here, engaged by Wilder, to kidnap the child.
THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER
Captain Peter Carey, a former whale fisher nicknamed "Black Peter" by his crew because of his dark moods, was living in Forest Row with the wife and daughter he often abused when he was drunk. He’s been murdered in the shed he built in his garden, where he used to sleep, his corpse pierced in the chest by a harpoon.
Stanley Hopkins, a young police inspector who admires Holmes, contacts the detective because he’s at his wit’s end on this case. All he found to go on is two rum glasses, a sealskin tobacco pouch with the initials P.C. inside (although the captain rarely smoked), and a bloodstained notebook containing figures in front of the initials JHN.
As the three men inspect the crime scene, Holmes notices the door has been unsuccessfully tampered with, so they decide to lie in ambush that night, presuming the thief will come back with better tools. And indeed, they catch a young man who breaks in to look at an account book. His name is John Hopley Neligan and he’s the son of a long-missing, failed banker. His father had sailed to Norway on a little yacht with a box of securities and never returned. However, some of those securities reappeared on the London market few months ago, sold by Carey. Neligan came to ask for explanations, but claims Carey was dead upon his arrival. Hopkins, unconvinced, arrests Neligan for the murder.
Holmes, realizing that the frail young man couldn’t have committed a murder requiring such physical strength, goes back to London and, under the name of Captain Basil, sends a telegram to recruit sailors. Three men show at his house and among them, Holmes handcuffs Patrick Cairns, a harpooner, who immediately confesses to the murder. In 1883, he saw Carey kill the banker Neligan and steal the securities. Shortly thereafter, the captain retired and Cairns started to search for him to claim his share. He met him in the shed, but the discussion turned to fight and, picking up the harpoon hanging on the wall, he impaled Carey with it.
THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON
Charles-Augustus Milverton is a professional blackmailer whose methodology is to buy letters which compromise people of wealth or position and then press them for large sums of money. He has achieved a fortune this way. Holmes, although he's repelled by this man, has been hired by Lady Brackwell, who is shortly to be married, to negotiate with Milverton in order to get back compromising letters she had written to a young man years ago.
Unfortunately, Holmes's attempt at negotiation fails, so he decides to infiltrate Milverton's house. Disguised as a plumber, he spends several days there and even gets engaged to the housemaid in order to get information and access. Finally, one night, thinking the way is clear, he decides to burgle Milverton's home, Appledore Towers, accompanied by Watson. The letters are locked in a safe in Milverton's study, next to the room where he's supposed to be sleeping. But Milverton arrives in his study, and the two burglars have just time enough to hide behind the curtains. Milverton has a late appointment with a woman who pretends she has letters to sell, but reveals herself to be a former victim of his. She shoots the blackmailer dead and leaves.
Immediately Holmes and Watson rush to open the safe and throw all the letters into the fireplace while the household staff attempts to break into the room, and they only just manage to escape before being caught.
The next day, Lestrade comes and asks Holmes to help him in the Milverton's murder case; giving the description of the men the servants witnessed fleeing. Holmes ironically retorts that one of them corresponds to a description of Watson and refuses. Later, Holmes will recognize the murderer as a high-ranking woman, but vows to keep silent forever.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS
Lestrade stops by to ask Holmes's opinion about a strange case: Someone is breaking into houses in London only to smash inexpensive plaster busts of Napoleon. Those casts all come from the same shop.
The next day, a telegram from the inspector invites Holmes and Watson to head to the home of a reporter, Horace Harker. Another bust has been smashed, this one purchased from a different merchant, named Harding. This time, however, they also found the corpse of a murdered man. The victim, of unknown identity, had a photograph of a man in his pocket.
At the first shop, owned by a Mr. Hudson, Holmes and Watson learn that the three busts he sold came from Gelder's factory, and the merchant recognizes the man in the photograph: His name is Beppo, a former employee of his who had left only days before. Gelder tells them that the busts he sold to Hudson and Harding — six in all — were from the same batch. He, too, recognizes Beppo, who had worked at his factory months earlier, before being sent to jail for stabbing a man in a fight. Finally, Harding gives the detective the names of the buyers of the three last busts: Harker, Brown and Sandford.
In the meantime, Lestrade has established the identity of the murdered man, Pietro Venucci, a Mafia killer. Holmes convinces the inspector to lie in ambush before Brown's house. There, they catch Beppo who had come to steal and smash another bust.
Holmes, who considers the case is not over, goes to Sandford and buys the last bust. He smashes it and finds, in the plaster fragments, the black pearl of the Borgias which had been stolen months ago by Lucrecia Venucci, Pietro's sister. Somehow, Beppo got this pearl, and just before he was jailed, hid it in a bust from a drying batch. Once released, he tracked those busts in order to find the pearl. He was tailed by Venucci, who was also after the pearl, and when the two men met at Harker's house they fought, resulting in Venucci's death.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE STUDENTS
Holmes and Watson are staying in a university town where Holmes is doing research into early English charters, when Professor Hilton Soames, a lecturer at the College of St Luke's, brings a case to the detective, relying on his discretion.
Soames had been reviewing galleys of a passage of Greek that was to be translated during an examination for the important Fortescue Scholarship. He left his study and when he returned he found that Bannister, his servant, had left the keys in the lock, and that the papers had disturbed in such a way as to make it clear that the passage had been at least partially copied. The thief left clues such as shavings from a pencil, a cut in the leather surface of the desk, and a small ball of black stuff. Inspecting the lecturer's bedroom, Holmes finds another ball of dough, and deduces that that is where the thief hid when he heard Soames coming back.
Three students, scheduled to take the examination, live above the study, and any of them could have seen the keys when using the staircase and be tempted to copy the galleys. Gilchrist is an excellent student and an athlete, Ras is a serious and peaceful Indian fellow, and McLaren is brilliant, but lazy and dissipated. Holmes visits them to check their pencils and their heights.
The next day, as they head back to the college, the detective tells Watson he has solved the mystery. He asks Soames to fetch Gilchrist and accuses him in Bannister's presence. The young man falls apart as Holmes explain what happened. He is tall enough to have seen the papers on the desk as he passed the window when coming back from athletic training holding his muddy shoes. Climbing the stairs, he saw the keys in the lock and couldn't resist the temptation to enter and copy the translation. When he heard Soames come back, he hid in the bedroom. Then Bannister, who had known Gilchrist since his childhood, helped him to escape, convinced the young man that he could not benefit from his actions. Gilchrist had already decided not to take part in the examination and to leave to take a commission in the Rhodesian Police.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ
On a stormy night, Inspector Hopkins turns up at Holmes and Watson's home to consult on a strange case: Professor Coram, an old invalid, lived in an isolated house in Yoxley Old Place in Kent with his secretary Willoughby Smith, who was helping him write a book. The young man was found murdered in the professor's study, while the professor was still in bed. The housemaid heard a hoarse scream and found Smith dying, his carotid artery cut, with a pince-nez clutched in his hand.
Examining the glasses, Holmes determines that they belong to a woman of good breeding, with a remarkably thick nose, and who is extremely short-sighed. The next day, Holmes meets Professor Coram, who claims to be totally unable to understand the murder, and then interviews the household and inspects the premises.
That afternoon, the detective tells the professor that he has solved the mystery: A woman came in the study to steal documents, but was caught by Smith who tried to grab her. She hit him with a random object, which turned out to be a knife, and killed him. Then she ran away, but having lost her glasses, she took a wrong turn and ended up in Coram's bedroom. The old man recognized her and helped her hide in a cupboard than Holmes then opens. The woman gets out and admits Holmes is right. She's Anna Coram, the professor's wife. Both of them are Russian and had belonged to a revolutionary and nihilist group that killed a police officer. Coram betrayed his companions and his wife and they were sent to Siberia while he emigrated to England. Among the prisoners was a man, Alexis, whom Anna loved and was innocent. When Anna was released, she came to England to get the papers exonerating Alexis, knowing her husband had them. She was looking for them when Smith found her. She entrusts Holmes with those papers, guessing he's a man of honour, and swallows a phial of deadly poison.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER
Cyril Overton, Cambridge student and rugby team skipper, comes and see Holmes and Watson at Baker Street on the advice of Inspector Stanley Hopkins. Godfrey Staunton, the irreplaceable three quarter of the team, is missing on the eve of a major match against Oxford. Overton had already wired to Staunton's only remaining family - his uncle, Lord Mount-James - but the rich old man hasn't replied. In any case, the young man didn't get on with his miserly uncle, who kept him in poverty.
Holmes interviews the hotel porter who tells them that on the previous night, the rugby player got a telegram at 6 PM and took his reply to the post office himself. At around 10 PM a man came around and Staunton left with him. By dint of a little trickery at the post office, Holmes learns that the telegram has been sent to a Doctor Leslie Armstrong in Cambridge. Holmes therefore decides to visit the physician, who turns to be Staunton trusted friend, but he's coldly received, the doctor fearing that the detective was hired by Lord Mount-James.
Holmes and Watson check into an inn in front of Armstrong house to monitor his doings and the detective tries to tail the doctor, but loses him. Furthermore, the doctor, who spotted Holmes, sends a telegram enjoining the detective to go back to London.
The next day, Holmes pours aniseed on Armstrong's carriage wheels so that, using a dog, he can track him to his destination. Holmes and Watson arrive at a house where they find Staunton in tears, kneeling beside his just-deceased wife. A year ago, they had married in secret so as not to cause Staunton to be disinherited by Lord Mount-James. Unfortunately, she contracted consumption. Staunton suffered during all the months when, to keep the marriage secret, he had to continue playing rugby and wasn't able to be at her side. When the end was near, the young woman's father picked him up and Staunton had rushed to her without a second thought.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE
On a winter morning, Holmes and Watson go off to Abbey Grange, in Kent in response to a request for help from Inspector Stanley Hopkins. It appears that during a burglary, Sir Eustace Brackenstall had been killed by a blow to the head.
Holmes interviews Lady Mary Brackenstall, a young Australian who has been unhappily married to Sir Eustace, who was a drunkard and an abusive husband, for the past year. She tells him that three men broke into the house as she entered the dining room and tied and gagged her, and that they killed Sir Eustace with a poker blow when he came, alerted by the noise. They took few pieces of silverware and each drank a glass of wine before they ran away. Her testimony suggests that the burglary is the work of the Randalls, a gang of burglars known to have been operating in the region lately. Holmes also has a chat with Theresa, Lady Brackenstall maid since childhood, who tells she didn't hear anything until her mistress screamed.
Holmes is puzzled by some facts that don't fit with the story - the knots around Lady Mary's wrists were nautical, and only one of the wineglasses has beeswing in it - and comes to the conclusion that the two women lied, but they stick to their version. Holmes and Watson return to London and visit the shipping office of the Adelaide-Southampton line, to get information about the crew that had travelled from Australia to England with Lady Mary. He summons then an officer named Jack Crocker, who finally admits he's guilty for the murder. He's in love with Lady Mary, and had recently seen Theresa, who told him about her mistress's miserable fate. He decided to go to the Abbey Grange to comfort her, but Sir Eustace caught them and attempted to beat his wife. Crocker fought to stop him and unintentionally killed him. With the help of Theresa, they decided to make up a story to conceal the manslaughter. Crocker doesn't want to leave his love in trouble and so takes full responsibility. Touched by his honesty, Holmes and Watson decide not to denounce him and let the official version be considered as truth, guessing true justice and law wouldn't run along the same lines on this case.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN
Lord Bellinger, a former prime minister, and Trelawney Hope, Secretary for European Affairs, show up at Baker Street about a case they want neither the police nor the public to be aware of. A critically important letter from a foreign potentate, which Hope had been keeping in his personal safe, has disappeared. Holmes knows of three international secret agents who would be interested in obtaining this document: Oberstein, La Rothière and Eduardo Lucas. He therefore intends to question them, but learns that Lucas has been murdered in his home. Meanwhile, Lady Hilda, Hope's wife, visits Holmes and begs him to reveal to her the contents of the letter. Holmes, who promised to the officials that he would keep the secret, refuses , which leaves Lady Hilda desperate.
A few days later, the press reveals that Lucas lead a double life and shared his time between London and Paris, where he was called Henri Fournaye and was married to a very jealous woman. She'd been seen around Lucas's home the night he was murdered and is naturally suspected.
Lestrade asks Holmes to come to Lucas's home to see something that puzzles the inspector: The blood stain on the carpet and the one on the floor don't match. The carpet has then been turned round after the murder, which, Holmes points out, means the constable must have let someone came in the house. While Lestrade interviews the constable, Holmes inspects the floor and finds an empty box in a cavity under the floor. He returns it to its hiding place before Lestrade reenters the room with the constable, who confesses that he left a young woman alone a little while in the room.
Holmes then go and see Lady Hilda and enjoins her to hand the stolen letter over to him. She bursts into tears and explains that Lucas was blackmailing her and demanded she gives him the letter he knew Hope was hiding. Owning a key to the safe, she complied, but saw where the scoundrel hid the letter. When she heard he had been murdered, she rushed to Lucas's house and tricked the constable in order to get the document back.
Holmes helps Lady Hilda by replacing the letter and convincing Hope that it never actually left the safe.
THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES
This adventure concerns the mysterious death of Sir Charles Baskerville, and the possibility that the heir to his fortune might be the object of murder. Before the novel begins, Sir Charles Baskerville had died suddenly, perhaps the victim of a ghostly hound believed to haunt his family because of an age-old curse. The Baskerville estate is located out in the remote moor of Devonshire.
Holmes and Watson are introduced to the case by Dr. Mortimer, a friend of Sir Charles Baskerville. Mortimer believes that a hound has in fact killed Sir Charles, because he found a paw print near Sir Charles's corpse. He is worried that there may be some truth to the superstitious legend, which is detailed in an old manuscript, and thus approaches Holmes in hopes that the detective can protect Sir Henry, who is soon to arrive to claim the family estate and fortune.
When Sir Henry arrives in London, he exhibits no fear of the old legend. Instead, he insists on leaving soon for Baskerville Hall. However, several strange things happen while he is in London: an anonymous letter arrives, warning him to stay away from the moor; two boots are stolen from his hotel, each from a different pair; and Holmes observes a bearded man following him around the city. Certain that something insidious is afoot, Holmes sends Watson to Devonshire, where he is to accompany and protect Sir Henry while Holmes wraps up some business in London.
Upon his arrival in Baskerville Hall, Watson begins his detective work. He discovers several mysterious circumstances. There is an escaped convict, Selden, wandering the moor. Barrymore, the butler, frequently awakes in the middle of the night and shines a light from an empty room in the house. Mrs. Barrymore is constantly in tears.
Watson also meets the Stapletons, a brother and sister who are friendly neighbors of the Baskerville estate. However, Miss Stapleton is clearly anxious, since she secretly warns Watson to leave the moor immediately, before learning he is not actually Sir Henry.
Watson learns from Mr. Stapleton about the existence of Grimpen Mire, a part of the moor which is too dangerous to pass. On several occasions, he hears the frightening howl of a hound coming from this area of the moor.
One night, Watson and Sir Henry follow Barrymore, and discover that he and his wife are secretly feeding Selden, who is actually Mrs. Barrymore's brother. Watson and Sir Henry try to capture Selden, but fail. However, that night, Watson sees a mysterious figure standing alone up in the hills.
The next morning, the men promise Barrymore not to report Selden, and he in turn tells them how his wife found a letter that was sent to Sir Charles on the day he died. Apparently, the man was outside that night to meet a woman with the initials L.L. Watson investigates to discover that this woman is Laura Lyons, who lives in the nearby Coombe Tracey. He visits her to learn that Sir Charles was going to give her money to secure a divorce, but that she did not keep her appointment that night because someone else offered her the money.
Watson then tries to track down the mysterious man on the moor, and discovers that it is actually Sherlock Holmes, who has been living secretly on the moor to observe the mystery from a distance. He explains that his open presence would have compromised his investigation. While there, Holmes has learned that Mr. Stapleton is in fact married to Miss Stapleton; they are not brother and sister, but have instead assumed fake identities. He believes Stapleton is responsible for Sir Charles's death, but he does not have the proof yet.
Suddenly, Watson and Holmes hear the same cry Watson heard earlier, and they rush to find a corpse out on the moor. Though they initially believe it is Sir Henry's body - since the figure is dressed in the man's clothes - they soon discover it is actually Selden's corpse. He had clearly been fleeing something, and had fallen from a cliff in the process. As they debate what to do with the body, Stapleton arrives. Though surprised, he quickly recovers his composure and easily identifies Sherlock Holmes.
Holmes accompanies Watson to Baskerville Hall, and has dinner with Sir Henry. During dinner, they learn that Stapleton had invited Sir Henry to dinner, and hence had been expecting him, not Selden, to be out on the moor that night. Selden was dressed in Sir Henry's clothes because Barrymore had given them to the convict.
Holmes notices a portrait of Hugo Baskerville, and secretly indicates to Watson that the face bears a striking similarity to Stapleton's. He thereby realizes that Stapleton must be a Baskerville, who hopes to kill off the surviving family members so that he will inherit the fortune.
However, Holmes does not tell Sir Henry the truth. Instead, he claims that he and Watson are returning to London, and instructs Sir Henry to join Stapleton for dinner the following night. Though it requires him walking alone across the moor, Sir Henry agrees.
That night, Holmes, Watson, and the London policeman Lestrade - who joined Holmes via train - stake out Stapleton's house. Watson sneaks close to spy Stapleton dining alone with Sir Henry; Miss Stapleton is absent. A fog compromises visibility, so the party has to retreat a bit. It is from this vantage that they soon see Sir Henry stroll past, and then a savage hound, flames seemingly leaping from its mouth, fly after the man. They are able to kill it only with several shots, right before it is prepared to rip out Sir Henry's throat.
Holmes studies the hound's corpse to discover that its mouth has been lined with phosphorus, thereby creating the image of flames, and its fur covered with a glitter. They try to pursue Stapleton, but only find Miss Stapleton, who has been tied up, gagged, and locked away in the house. She tells them that Stapleton had restrained her, and likely fled out into Grimpen Mire, which is where he kept the hound locked away.
The next morning, they search Grimpen Mire, but find only Stapleton's boot. They assume he has died. They also find evidence of where he kept the hound, and that Stapleton had been feeding the beast with other animals.
A month later, Sir Henry and Dr. Mortimer embark on a trip around the world, so that Sir Henry can recover from his shock. One day, Watson questions Holmes about the case, and the detective provides all the missing pieces. Stapleton's actual name was Rodger Baskerville; he is the son of Sir Charles's youngest brother, who had long before moved to South America. After his father's death, Stapleton fled to England, changed his identity, and set out to construct a means to claim the Baskerville fortune. His wife had eventually tried to stop him, which is why he locked her away.
The details provided, Holmes invites Watson to join him for dinner and a show.
THE VALLEY OF FEAR
The Valley of Fear begins with Sherlock Holmes, the famous detective, and Dr. Watson, his comrade and roommate at 221B Baker Street, in mid-conversation. Holmes is puzzling over an encrypted message that he received from Porlock, an associate of Holmes’ nemesis, Professor Moriarty. A second message from Porlock, which was supposed to contain the key to the coded message, soon arrives, stating that he (Porlock) is afraid of Moriarty’s wrath and will not reveal the purpose of his correspondence. Holmes soon deciphers the message regardless, and discovers that it warns that Douglas of Birlstone is in imminent danger. The two are soon visited by MacDonald, a policeman friend of Holmes, who informs them that this same Douglas has been murdered.
Upon inspection of the dead man, it is revealed that he has been killed with a sawed off shotgun, an American weapon. Beside the disfigured body lies a card inscribed 'V.V. 341'. Other clues in the room include a bloody footprint on the windowsill, a missing dumb-bell, and the fact that the man’s wedding ring is missing. Another clue discovered soon after is a bicycle, concealed just outside the house grounds. Interrogation of the house servants reveals little, and after Mrs. Douglas, wife of the murdered man, and Cecil Barker, a friend of the family, are questioned, Holmes reveals to Watson that he believes the two are in a conspiracy together.
Although the other detectives on the scene share their own theories, Holmes informs Watson that he believes the case hangs entirely on the missing dumb-bell, the one piece of evidence deemed trivial by the police force. Holmes announces that he is going to spend the night alone in the room in which Douglas was murdered, taking nothing with him but Watson’s umbrella. The day after Holmes’ vigil, he reveals to the police force investigating Douglas’ murder that he has solved the case, and asks them to join him in a stakeout that night.
During the stakeout, which takes place in the bushes outside of the room in which the crime was committed, Holmes, Watson, and the other detectives witness a man lean out the window and fish something out of the moat that surrounds the house. When the group confronts the figure, they discover it is Cecil Barker, and that the object he has taken from the moat is a bag, weighed down with the missing dumb-bell. Within the bag is a suit of clothing, boots, and a knife. During his stay in the room, Holmes discovered this same bag using the crook of Watson’s umbrella, and put it back to wait for Barker to retrieve it. To the astonishment of the others, Holmes reveals that Douglas is still alive. Upon saying this, a hidden compartment in the room opens, and Douglas himself steps out.
Douglas proceeds to explain that he had been hunted for some time by a man named Baldwin, who later attempted to kill him. The two struggled, and Baldwin died when the shotgun went off in his face. With the assistance of his wife and Barker, Douglas concocted a plan to fake his own death, taking advantage of the fact that Baldwin’s disfigured face would prevent an accurate identification. Douglas explains that there are others who would seek his life, and his apparent death would enable him to shake them off forever. Douglas gives Watson a manuscript, which he says details his past life, and tells of the men who wish him dead. After this, the novel shifts to Part II, which deals with Douglas’ life in America.
Part II begins with a man named Jack McMurdo, (whom we later discover is Douglas). McMurdo journeys to Vermissa Valley, a coal mining district in the western United States. McMurdo expresses an extreme hatred of policemen, which attracts the attention of a man named Scanlan. Scanlan reveals himself to be a member of the order of the Freemen, a society to which McMurdo also belongs. McMurdo soon joins the local lodge of Freemen, headed up by a cruel, violent man named Boss McGinty. It is revealed that the Freemen of this district go by another name: the Scowrers, a Mafia-like society that oppresses the people of Vermissa Valley. McMurdo proves to be just as violent as the rest, and he soon becomes a prominent member of the Scowrers.
The gang continues their reign of terror without being challenged, until they learn that Birdy Edwards, a Pinkerton detective, is on their trail. McMurdo informs the lodge that he knows who Birdy Edwards is, and he lays a plan to capture him. McMurdo lures Edwards to his apartment, where Boss McGinty and several of the other prominent members of the gang are concealed. McMurdo suddenly turns the tables on the Scowrers by revealing that he himself is Birdy Edwards, and that he joined the lodge only to gain information to use against them. McGinty and several of the others are hanged based on McMurdo’s testimony, and the others are sent to prison. Edwards, knowing the vindictive nature of the gang, disappears, eventually ending up in England, where events play out as detailed in Part I.
After Douglas’ remarkable story, Holmes warns the man to remain on his guard, as Moriarty, whom Baldwin contacted to locate Douglas’ whereabouts, will no doubt attempt to kill Douglas himself. Douglas agrees and goes back into hiding.
Sometime after Douglas flees England, Holmes receives a cryptic message which reads only “Dear me, Mr. Holmes, dear me!” (319). From this, Holmes deduces that Moriarty, the sender of the note, has succeeded in killing Douglas. Watson and McDonald speculate as to whether or not Moriarty will ever be brought to justice. Holmes assures them that he will capture the Professor, but he needs time in order to do so.
THE ADVENTURE OF WISTERIA LODGE
John Scott Eccles, a proper English gentleman, visits Holmes to tell him about the “grotesque” events of the previous night. He was invited to visit Wisteria Lodge by one Aloysus Garcia, a man seemingly working for the Spanish embassy, that he knew slightly. His host seemed preoccupied all evening, and his mood worsened when he received a note that he crumpled and threw out. Later, when Scott Eccles was in bed, Garcia came to his room to ask why he rang at one in the morning although, being that he was asleep, he obviously had not. When he woke up in the morning, Eccles was stunned to find that everyone had vanished. Back in London, he inquired about Garcia and discovered that nobody at the embassy knew him.
While Eccles is talking to Holmes, Inspectors Gregson and Baynes arrive to tell them that Garcia's corpse has been found on a common near Wisteria Lodge with his head smashed. The policemen found the invitation he sent to Eccles in his pocket, which makes Eccles a suspect. They also found the letter Garcia had received and crumpled the previous night, written in a woman's handwriting.
Holmes realizes that Eccles' presence at Wisteria Lodge, together with his night-time awakening, was supposed to be used as an alibi for Garcia, who must have had a criminal intent that backfired. The detective also deduces that the woman who wrote the note must be Garcia's accomplice, and must be living in the neighbouring area. The next day Holmes and Watson book rooms in an inn in Esher, and as Holmes tries to collect information, his attention focuses on the curious Mr. Henderson of High Gable Grange. Miss Burnett, the governess of Henderson's daughters, disappeared the same night Garcia was killed.
Shortly thereafter, the governess is found and taken to Holmes and Watson. She's exhausted and has likely been drugged. Henderson was getting onto the train and pushing her into the carriage, but she struggled with him and escaped. Once her strength returns, she tells Holmes her story: Henderson is really Don Murillo, a bloodthirsty tyrant who lead a reign of terror some years ago in Central America. He was overthrown, but somehow managed to escape to Europe. The relatives of his former victims, including Garcia and Miss Burnett (whose real name is Senora Durando) have tracked him down for revenge. She got herself hired as governess in order to be able to inform the others about Murillo's doings. Garcia was supposed to come to enact the revenge, but Murillo discovered the plot, held Miss Burnett prisoner, and killed the young man.

THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARDBOARD BOX
Holmes, Watson and Lestrade visit Susan Cushing, who has just received by mail two human ears in a cardboard box. Susan says that James Browner, a steward who married his younger sister, Mary, while drinking, had a fight with Mary and Sarah, Susan's second sister. The three men tried in vain to meet Sarah at her home but she was supposedly sick. Then Holmes asked Lestrade to arrest Browner as soon as he arrived in London. Browner confessed that Sarah had made advances to him, but when she was rejected, she managed to convince Mary that her husband was cheating on her, Mary fell in love with another sailor, Alec Fairbaim. Browner followed his wife and Fairbain to New Brighton where he murdered them. He cut off one ear to each and sent the macabre package to the address where he thought Sarah Cushing was living. However, only Susan Cushing lived there.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE RED CIRCLE
Ms. Warren, a landlady, comes to see Holmes because of her concerns about a lodger, a young man who paid for 15 days in advance before leaving the house only to come back very late and has not been seen since. He asked specifically not to be disturbed in any way; meals are laid at his door and he leaves notes to ask for what he needs, in particular the Daily Gazette. Holmes, intrigued, speculates that the current occupant is a not the one who rented, but could be someone who is hiding and receives news from the outside through the classifieds. He then finds ads in the newspaper signed by "G," the last of them saying that a coded message will be sent the same night from a building near Mrs. Warren's house. To test his hypothesis, Holmes decides to get a look at the lodger. He and Watson hide in a closet and, by use of a mirror they see a young women opening the door to take the tray with her meal. Holmes deduces that the man who rented room and this young woman are a couple in mortal danger. That evening, Holmes and Watson watch for the coded message that, according to the latest classified ad, will be sent from the nearby building. They're surprised to meet Inspector Gregson accompanied by an American detective, Leverton, who is chasing Gorgiano, a murderer and a giant of a man, who has just entered the building from which the signals are coming. The four men enter and find Gorgiano dead in an empty room. Then the young woman hiding in Mrs. Warren's house, whom Holmes had summoned via a coded message of his own, arrives and is delighted to see Gorgiano dead. She tells them that her name is Emilia Lucca. She had married a young man named Gennaro, who had naively associated himself with a criminal group called "The Red Circle" a few years earlier. The couple immigrated to New York to escape the group and to start a new life, but the Red Circle found them and sent Gorgiano to try to force Gennaro to commit a murder. Instead Gennaro warned the victim and the police, and then they fled again, to London, where Gorgiano was still tracking them. That night he had found Gennaro in the building, they fought and Gennaro killed Gorgiano. After she told her story, Leverton, Gregson, Holmes, and Watson are unanimous in thinking that since it was so clearly a case of self-defense, no court would imprison her husband for this killing.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRUCE-PARTINGTON PLANS
One morning in November 1895, Sherlock Holmes is very surprised to receive a visit from his brother Mycroft, bringing him the case of Arthur Cadogan West. West was a civil servant found dead on subway tracks at Aldgate, with plans of a top secret submarine plans on his person. According to Mycroft, the plans were kept in a safe whose keys are held by men considered to be above suspicion: Sir James Walter and Sidney Johnson. Arthur Cadogan West was known as a serious employee, and Johnson's deputy. It is believed he stole plans to sell them and was killed during the transaction. But Holmes wonders why Cadogan West had stolen the plans while he could copy them.
Visiting the crime scene, Holmes deduces that the body fell from the roof of a subway car. He decides to pay a visit to Sir James, but only meets Sir James' brother, Colonel Valentine Walter, as Sir James has just died, stunned by the dishonor. Holmes and Watson then visit Cadogan West's fiancée, who informs him that the young man left her without explanation on the way to the theatre the night of the murder.
Holmes asks his brother which foreign agents are likely to have been interested in buying the plans. One of them, Hugo Oberstein, attracts Holmes' interest because his house has windows that overlook a railway. Accompanied by Watson, Holmes breaks into Oberstein's home and discovers traces of blood and an envelope of messages clipped from the Daily Telegraph's agony column referring to the transaction. Holmes then places an ad in the same newspaper to make an appointment with Oberstein's accomplice. Colonel Valentine Walter, brother of Sir James responds to the ad and is arrested. He admits that, pressed by debt, he stole the safe's keys and contacted Oberstein. Cadogan West, on the way to the theater, saw Colonel Walter enter the offices and followed him to the Oberstein's house. The spy killed the young man and threw his body on the roof of a train car, putting the less important pages of the plans in his pockets so that he will be believed to be the thief.
Holmes asks Colonel Walter, guilt ridden, to write to Oberstein requesting an appointment. The latter comes to the rendez-vous and is arrested. The Bruce-Partington plans are therefore found before being sold to a foreign power; as a result, Holmes returned from a day at Windsor a few weeks later with a fine emerald tie-pin.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE
The Adventure of the Dying Detective focuses mainly on Sherlock Holmes himself, who claims to be quite ill and about to die from a Sumatran disease. Mrs. Hudson, his housekeeper, is quite worried about him, so she convinces Dr. Watson to visit him in the apartment. Once Watson has seen Holmes, he too is convinced that Holmes is dying, so he leaves to fetch the one person who Holmes claims can save him: Culverton Smith. Watson returns to Holmes's apartment before Smith, and hides behind the bed in order to overhear what Smith and Holmes discuss. Smith admits to Holmes that he killed his own nephew, and also that he sent Holmes a package designed to infect him with the same disease. Holmes asks Smith to light the gas; this signals the presence of an investigator who is waiting outside to come inside and arrest Smith.
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF LADY FRANCES CARFAX
Miss Dobney, Lady Frances Carfax's former housekeeper, who was used to get letters from her mistress on a regular basis, is alarmed by her sudden silence. She asks Sherlock Holmes to ascertain her whereabouts. The detective is quite worried about this young woman, who's travelling on her own, carrying valuable jewellery with her. He sends Watson to Lausanne where Lady Frances has been staying lately. On site, the doctor learns that she left in a hurry for Baden after a strange bearded man payed her a visit. Watson then tracks her into Germany where she apparently formed friendship with two missionaries, Dr. Schlessinger and his wife. The three of them left town at the same time, but Watson also learns that the bearded man preceded him in Baden to ask the same questions.
Clueless, Watson heads to Montpellier to speak to Marie Devine, Lady Frances's former chambermaid, who left her mistress in Lausanne to get married. As Watson notices he's spied by the bearded man, he goes after him and they fight. He's rescued by a workman, who turns out to be Holmes in a disguise. The detective conducted a parallel investigation and discovered the identity of the bearded man. This is Philip Green, Lady Frances's former suitor, who left England few years ago after some misdemeanours, but is now back to propose her.
Back in London, Holmes gets his suspicions about Schlessinger confirmed. He is Holy Peters, a crook whose targets are young, lonely and wealthy ladies. With the help of Green, Holmes and Watson locate him and learn he has just ordered a special coffin. Fearing the worst, they toughly visit the crook, but to no avail, as it's Peters old nanny who lays in the coffin. Holmes spends the night brooding over his failure and then has an epiphany. He wakes Watson up in the wee hours of the morning and takes him to the nanny's funeral. The detective forcibly opens the coffin and find Lady Frances, unconscious but alive, in the double-bottom in which Peters was about to bury her.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL'S FOOT
In 1897, under Dr. Moore Agar warning of a complete breakdown from exhaustion, Holmes is persuaded to take a holiday. The detective and Watson take a trip to Poldhu Bay in Cornwall. One morning, the parish priest and his tenant, Mortimer Tregennis, interrupt Holmes's rest to consult Holmes about a tragedy. Tregennis had just found his sister, Brenda, dead and his two brothers, Owen and George, in a state close to madness. All three were still around the table where Mortimer had left them the previous evening, after they had played cards together. Nobody seems to have entered the room and no traces of violence are visible. The housekeeper and Mortimer believe all this is the Devil's work, which Holmes refutes.
Later, Leon Sterndale, a famous lion hunter who stays in his Cornish home between expeditions, visits Holmes and Watson and asks eagerly about the case. Holmes tells him that he has no theory thus far. The next morning, the priest runs to Holmes again, announcing that Mortimer Tregennis had died in the same circumstances as the rest of his family. Holmes rushes to the scene of the crime to collect clues. Noting that the first people to enter each room after the murders had fainted, and that there had been a flame in both rooms (from the grate in the first and a lamp in the second), he deduces that a toxic substance was added to the fire, causing intoxication to those who were exposed to the fumes. Using the dust from Mortimer's lamp Holmes attempts to repeat the experience in the cottage and nearly kills both himself and Watson, but fortunately the latter manages to gather his strength and pull them both outside.
Holmes concludes that Mortimer Tregennis killed his family because he was the only person able to leave the poison in the fireplace. Then Holmes summons Leon Sterndale and accuses him of the second murder. After a brief resistance, the hunter confesses that he killed Mortimer to avenge Brenda, who he had loved for years. He had known about Mortimer's guilt because he had recently shown him some African curiosities, including a poison called "Devil's-foot root", and had recognized its effects at the scene of the first murder.
Convinced that the police would fail to condemn the guilty, he carried out a sentence himself, using the same poison on Mortimer as he had used on his siblings, before returning to Africa forever. Holmes, moved by his story, let him go without handing him over to the police.
HIS LAST BOW
This rare third person account of the skills of Sherlock Holmes not written as an account by his boon companion John Watson has the legendary consulting detective coming out of his self-imposed retirement to Sussex to raise and study bees. At the center of suspense stands one Herr Von Bork, a German intelligence agent who has been a nefarious presence in English for four years, operating without the least bit of concern of punishment and, along the way, building up a rather substantial and impressive amount of wealth.
Baron Von Herling is seated with Von Bork in the luxury of his Harwich home, enjoying the vitriol his friend is directing toward the very basic elemental component of character among the Brits. His work close to ending, he has merely to meet with an Irish-American agent named Altamont whose own scorn for the English is nearly a match for the German’s. At the heart of the espionage being conducted is the transfer of England’s secret naval signals to the waiting hands of Germany.
Von Herling takes his leave and Von Bork’s housekeeper, Martha retires for the evening, allowing Altamont to arrive with his chauffeur without fear of undo tension. Unfortunately for Von Bork, Altamont is anything but uneasy: questions pour forth that bring into question whether the German has taken all necessary security precautions. He also expresses concern about the manner in which the Germans seem to routinely bring the lives of agents to a swift end immediately upon the realization that they no long prove useful. Altamont wants his money before delivering the goods. Von Born wants to inspect the goods before delivering the payoff.
A standoff ensues.
Von Bork’s own lack of trust in Altamont turns out to be ideally placed. The intelligence which he is eager to retrieve and hand over to his superiors back in Germany is not exactly what he is expecting. The parcel which is handed over by Altamont turns out to be a book. A book titled Practical Handbook of Bee Culture. While this is certainly an unexpected turn of events, what happens next is even more so: a rag soaked in chloroform pressed against his face.
The Irish-American Altamont turns out to be none other than Sherlock Holmes in one of many disguises. And the chauffeur who delivered him to Von Bork’s luxurious home? None other than Dr. Watson. Only after the revelation of the true identity of Altamont is it revealed that Sherlock Holmes has been hot on the trail of the German agent for two years in an investigation which has seen him travel from Ireland to Chicago to the East Coast of England. Not only was John Watson recruited to take part in the sting operation, but it has been suggested that Mrs. Hudson herself may well have been the housekeeper of Von Bork who was also in on the game that was afoot right beneath the German’s nose
THE ILLUSTRIOUS CLIENT
Sir James Damery comes to see Holmes and Watson about his illustrious client's problem (the client's identity is never revealed to the reader, although Watson finds out at the end of the story; it is heavily implied to be King Edward VII). General de Merville's young daughter Violet has fallen in love with the roguish and sadistic Austrian Baron Adelbert Gruner, who Damery and Holmes are convinced is a shameless philanderer and a murderer. The victim was his last wife, of whose murder he was acquitted owing to a legal technicality and a witness's untimely death. She met her end in the Splügen Pass. Holmes also finds out that the Baron has expensive tastes and is a collector and a recognised authority on Chinese pottery.
Holmes's first step is to see Gruner, who is amused to see Holmes trying to "play a hand with no cards in it". The Baron will not be moved and claims that his charm is more potent than even a post-hypnotic suggestion in conditioning Violet's mind to reject anything bad that might be said about him. Gruner tells the story of Le Brun, a French agent who was crippled for life after being beaten by thugs after making similar inquiries into the Baron's personal business.
Holmes gets some help with his mission in the form of Shinwell Johnson, a former criminal who now acts as an informer for Holmes in London's underworld. Johnson rakes up Miss Kitty Winter, the Baron's last mistress, who was ruined because of it. She is bent on revenge and will do anything to help Holmes. Kitty tells Holmes that the Baron "collects women" and chronicles his conquests in a book. Holmes realises that this book, written in Gruner's own hand, is the key to curing Violet of her devotion to the scoundrel. Kitty tells Holmes that this book is kept in the Baron's study.
First, Holmes goes to see Violet, bringing Kitty with him, but Violet is proof against Holmes's words. Kitty then makes it clear that Violet might end up dead if she is foolish enough to marry Gruner. The meeting ends with Holmes narrowly averting a public scene involving the enraged Kitty.
Next, Holmes is attacked by two men, and the newspapers imply that he is near death. Watson goes to 221B Baker Street only to discover that Holmes's injuries have been exaggerated to give the impression that he will be out of action for quite a while. Several days later, Holmes is sufficiently recovered to be out of bed. The Baron is planning a trip to the United States just before the wedding and will be leaving in three days. Holmes knows that Gruner will take his incriminating book with him, never daring to leave it behind in his study.
Holmes orders Watson to learn everything that he can about Chinese pottery in the next 24 hours. The next day, Holmes presents Watson with a fake business card styling him as "Dr. Hill Barton" and an actual piece of Ming pottery, a saucer. He is to go to Baron Gruner's house, pose as a connoisseur of Chinese pottery, and try to sell the saucer. Watson does as Holmes tells him but cannot fool the Baron for very long. Gruner realises who has sent him.
As Watson faces his murderous captor, a noise from another room alerts the Baron and he rushes into his study just in time to see Holmes jump out of the window. The Baron rushes to the window, but Kitty Winter, who has been hiding outside, throws oil of vitriol in his face. Watson applies treatment to his injuries. During Holmes' visit he manages to steal the book.
The Baron is now hideously disfigured, but Holmes says this will not put Violet off him. They still need the book to cure her. When Violet sees the book of conquests, written in her fiancé's handwriting, she realises what a rogue he is. An announcement in The Morning Post says that the marriage between Baron Adelbert Gruner and Miss Violet de Merville is off. It also says vitriol-throwing charges are being pressed against Kitty Winter. Extenuating circumstances reduce her sentence to the lowest possible for such an offence.
THE BLANCHED SOLDIER
Parents hide a young man who fought in Africa, and do not allow him to communicate with people. Sherlock Holmes finds out that the young man is mistakenly considered a leper, and brings a doctor to him who is taken to cure him.
Sherlock Holmes is being contacted by retired military officer Mr. James Dodd. While serving in the army, he became friends with Godfrey Emsworth, the only son in the family. In one of the battles, Godfrey was wounded and sent to a hospital. First, friends corresponded, but then correspondence broke off. Mr. Dodd turned to Godfrey's parents. His father, Colonel Emsworth, wrote a rude reply in which he informed that Godfrey had gone on a world trip and would return no sooner than a year later. Mr. Dodd did not satisfy this answer; he wrote to Godfrey's mother, and she invited him to visit them. Arriving, Mr. Dodd continued to question, but received no reply.
In the evening, a butler came into his room, who began to question how Godfrey fought. He and his wife raised a young man and treated him like a son. In the conversation, the butler spoke of his young master as a dead man and hinted that it would be better if he died. Suddenly, Mr. Dodd saw Godfrey with a dead white face.
Mr. Dodd decided to examine the estate. In one of the many buildings, he met a bearded man who, learning that Mr. Dodd was a friend of Godfrey, felt that Godfrey had left. Here in the building window, Mr. Dodd saw Godfrey. Appearing Colonel Emsworth clearly hinted that the nearest train to London was leaving soon. Having quarreled with him, Mr. Dodd left and now asks the great detective for help.
A few days later, Sherlock Holmes with Mr. Dodd and his acquaintance set off for Emsworth Manor. Arriving opens a butler. Holmes immediately notes that in his hands are leather gloves with a characteristic tar smell.
When the colonel finds out about the visitors, he wants to call the police and drive out uninvited guests, but the great detective shows him a piece of paper on which something is written, and Mr. Emsworth leads the guests to Godfrey.
The face of the young man is disfigured by white spots, and the bearded man who is near Godfrey forbids approaching him. Being wounded in Africa, Godfrey was hospitalized for lepers and was infected there. Now he lives at home under the supervision of a doctor in complete isolation.
The great detective immediately realized that Godfrey was ill with something and therefore they were hiding him, and when he heard about his white complexion, he realized that it was leprosy, which he wrote on a piece of paper. He brought with him a specialist dermatologist who wants to examine the patient.
An examination shows that the young man has no leprosy, but another skin disease that is not contagious and can be cured, albeit with difficulty.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE MAZARIN STONE
To return the stolen diamond, the government turns to Sherlock Holmes, and he deftly deceives scammers who stole the stone.
Representatives of the government of the country are asking the great detective Sherlock Holmes to find the stolen diamond, known as the «Mazarin Stone». The Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior hope for success, while Lord Cantlemere doubts the possibilities of a great detective.
After investigating, Holmes discovers that the stone was kidnapped by Earl Silvius with the help of his assistant Sam Merton. The great detective traced the path of the kidnapper, found the kebmen who carried him, and the jeweler, who refused to cut the stone and told everything to Holmes. To return the jewel, the great detective orders his wax statue and hides it in his office behind the curtain.
Earl Sylvius arrives on Baker Street. When he sees the statue, he takes it for Holmes and tries to strike from behind, but alive Holmes enters the room and offers the count to return the stone in exchange for Holmes closing the case and no one will know the truth. Count refuses. Holmes invites Sam, invites accomplices to decide whether to return the stone or not, and defiantly leaves for his office to play the violin. Earl and Sam are developing a plan to lead the great detective on the wrong track. Burning with curiosity, Sam asks the owner to give him a look at the stone, but when the earl pulls him out, Holmes jumps off the chair where the mannequin stands and picks up the jewel. Through a secret door, the great detective entered the office and sat in a chair instead of a statue, and instead of a violin he played a gramophone. The police take the criminals, and Lord Cantlemere arrives on Baker Street. In a conversation with him, Holmes asks who should be considered guilty of the abduction. The lord smugly replies that the culprit will be the one who will find the stone. Holmes takes a stone from the lord's pocket.
The Lord apologizes for doubting Holmes' abilities, and Holmes apologizes for a peculiar joke.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE GABLES
A woman wants to buy a house with all things. Sherlock Holmes discovers that strange buyers need an affair that describes the affair of the deceased son of a woman with a well-known socialite beauty.
A hefty black man breaks into Baker Street’s apartment and threatens Sherlock Holmes. Holmes knows that he was sent to him by a certain Barney Stockdale, the leader of one of the gangs.
Immediately, Mrs. Mary Mayberly turns to Sherlock Holmes for help. She asks the great detective to come to her Villa Three Skates. Mrs. Mayberly lives in the villa for more than a year, leads a secluded lifestyle and communicates mainly with her neighbors. A month ago, her only son, Douglas, who worked as a military attache in Rome, died of pneumonia.
A few days ago, a real estate agent came to her and offered to sell the house for a large sum - he liked one of his clients. The woman agreed, but to her lawyer the conditions of sale seemed strange. She was offered to sell a house with all things. An exception will be made for personal items, but only after a preliminary check.
During the conversation, Holmes notices that Mrs. Mayberly's maid, Susan, is eavesdropping under the door. Realizing that the great detective guessed that she was spying on behalf of Barney Stockdale, Susan leaves the house.
Holmes assumes that they are hunting for the house, because there is something extremely valuable in it, but Mrs. Mayberly does not own anything that could interest. Holmes suggests asking a lawyer to spend several days in the villa and not leave the woman alone. Suddenly he notices chests and knots in the corner. These are the things Douglas sent after his death. Holmes says that they need to be carefully examined, it is quite possible that the hunt is following them.
Mrs. Mayberly neglects the advice of the great detective, and the next day, thieves enter the house on a tip from Susan. After them, there is only one piece left, written by Douglas and similar to the end of the novel. On the sheet was a description of an unsuccessful love affair, but in style it was clear that the person first wrote about himself, and then changed the first person to the third.
Holmes inquires. Douglas had an affair with Isadora Klein, a well-known secular beauty, a Spanish by birth. She was going to marry the count, who was her sons by age.
Holmes visits Isadora. By threatening her with police, the great detective learns that Isadora tried to get rid of Douglas's courtship by hiring Barney Stockdale and his wife Susan. The hooligans beat him, but he wrote a novel and wanted to publish it. Due to his sudden death, the novel was not published, and Isadora tried to get it. Holmes takes a check for a decent amount from her so that Mrs. Meberly could go around the world.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE
The young Peruvian woman is accused of vampirism. Sherlock Holmes argues that she was saving the baby - the half-brother pricked him with a poisoned needle, and the woman tried to suck out the poison.
Mr. Robert Ferguson is turning to Sherlock Hill for help. A few years ago, he married a beautiful young Peruvian woman, but after a while his love for her began to cool, although his wife still loves him. From his first marriage, he has a fifteen-year-old son, Jack, who injured his spine and became crippled. He and his wife dislike each other - the wife, without the slightest excuse, pounces on him. Once hit so hard that she left a scar. But even worse, she refers to their common child.
Once, the nurse left the baby alone for several minutes, and when she returned, she saw her mother bite her teeth into the neck of the child, so that blood flowed from the wound. The nurse wanted to call for help, but the woman asked not to tell anyone and even paid for silence. The frightened maid began to monitor the child day and night, but the mother also watched him.
Unable to stand it, the nurse confessed everything to Ferguson, who decided that it was the fruit of her sore imagination, but then a child cried out. They rushed into the room and saw that there was blood on the baby’s sheet, and her mother’s lips were bleeding from her mother’s bed. Mr. Ferguson locked his wife, who refused to give any explanations, considering her a vampire, and he himself asks the great detective to come to his estate and sort out the situation.
Arriving at Mr. Ferguson’s home in Sussex, Holmes sees collections of South American utensils and weapons. He also draws attention to the spaniel, which four months ago fell ill with meningitis. Holmes comes into the room to Mrs. Ferguson. A woman has a nervous breakdown due to the inability to see the child. Having met Mr. Fergusson’s children and his servants, Holmes writes a sick note asking for a meeting.
Dr. Watson, Holmes and Mr. Ferguson come to her room. Holmes removes all suspicions from a woman, considering the stupidity of the charge of vampirism. The woman was afraid for the child and sucked poison out of the wound. She was afraid to discover the truth, since the culprit was Jack, who hates his stepmother and is jealous of his father for his new wife and little son. Before injecting the baby with a poisonous needle, which he took from a collection of weapons, Jack tried the poison on a spaniel.
The great detective advises Mr. Fergusson to send Jack on a trip, and gives the husband and wife the opportunity to sort things out themselves.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE GARRIDEBS
The culprit promises the peaceful archaeologist more inheritance to remove him from the apartment where the machine that prints counterfeit money is hidden. Sherlock Holmes exposes and catches the criminal.
Sherlock Holmes seeks help from attorney John Garrydeb, an American living in London.
Alexander Garideb, his namesake from Kansas, made a great fortune. Having no relatives, he turned to John Garrideb as a man with such a rare surname, asking him to find someone else named Harrideb. He will share his entire fortune if he finds three men.
John Garrydeb combed the whole of America, but found no one. Finally, in England, he found Nathan Garrideb, who has no male relatives. John Garrydeb asks the great detective to help find a third.
Holmes agrees, but does not believe a single word of his client. He meets with Nathan Garrideb, an elderly archaeologist who rarely leaves the house. Nathan Garrideb became interested in the opportunity to receive a solid inheritance. Holmes inspects his collection, but there is nothing significant in it. Here appears John Garrideb with the news that a third heir has been found, and now all three need to go to Birmingham to receive an inheritance. Nathan does not want to make such a long trip, but Holmes persuades him to go.
The great detective finds that John Garrideb is the «Evans killer,» the most dangerous criminal. The great detective learns that earlier in the apartment that Nathan Garrideb rented, there lived a bandit killed by Evans.
The next day, Holmes lurking in an apartment catches a criminal who hid a printing press and fake money there. Evans made up the inheritance story to remove Mr. Garrideb from the apartment. Unfortunately, because of the shattered hopes of an inheritance, Nathan Garrideb ends up in a psychiatric hospital.
THE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE
Neil Gibson, the Gold King and former senator from "some Western state", approaches Holmes to investigate the murder of his wife Maria in order to clear his children's governess, Grace Dunbar, of the crime. It soon emerges that Mr. Gibson's marriage had been unhappy and he treated his wife very badly. He had fallen in love with her when he met her in Brazil, but soon realised they had nothing in common. He became attracted to Miss Dunbar; since he could not marry her, he had attempted to please her in other ways, such as trying to help people less fortunate than himself.
Maria Gibson was found lying in a pool of blood on Thor Bridge with a bullet through the head and note from the governess, agreeing to a meeting at that location, in her hand. A recently discharged revolver with one shot fired is found in Miss Dunbar's wardrobe. Holmes agrees to look at the situation in spite of the damning evidence.
From the outset, Holmes observes some rather odd things about the case. How could Miss Dunbar so coolly and rationally have planned and carried out the murder and then carelessly tossed the murder weapon into her wardrobe? What was the strange chip on the underside of the bridge's stone balustrade? Why was Mrs. Gibson clutching the note from Miss Dunbar when she died? If the murder weapon was one of a matched pair of pistols, why couldn't the other one be found in Mr. Gibson's collection?
Holmes uses his powers of deduction to solve the crime, and demonstrates, using Watson's revolver, how it was perpetrated: Mrs Gibson, outraged and jealous of Miss Dunbar's relationship with her husband, resolved to end her own life and frame her rival for the crime. After arranging a meeting with Miss Dunbar, requesting her to leave her response in a note, Mrs Gibson tied a rock on a piece of string to the end of a revolver, and shot herself, the rock pulling the revolver over the side of the bridge; the revolver found in Miss Dunbar's wardrobe was the other pistol of the pair, which had been fired off in the woods earlier, and the chip in the bridge was caused by the pistol hitting the stonework as it was pulled off by the rock. Holmes's reconstruction reproduces the damage to the balustrade of the bridge. He asks the police to drag the lake for the revolvers of Watson and Gibson.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE CREEPING MAN
An elderly professor falls in love with a young girl and leaves for London. Upon returning from the professor, strange attacks begin. Sherlock Holmes discovers that the cause of the attacks is an anti-aging drug.
Sherlock Holmes is being asked for help by a young man, Mr. Bennet, who is an assistant to the famous Professor Presbury and the groom of his only daughter.
Professor Presbury, a famous European scientist, in whose life science is in the first place, is a widower with an impeccable reputation. A few months ago, a professor who was sixty-one years old, with the fiery passion of a young man, made an offer to the daughter of his colleague. The girl liked him, but his age interfered. Around the same time, the professor left and did not tell anyone where. His family accidentally learned that he was in Prague.
Upon returning to the professor, strange things began to happen. He received letters marked with a cross from London, which Mr. Bennett, the personal secretary of the professor, was forbidden to open. Once, the professor was very angry when Mr. Bennett accidentally picked up the box that he brought from the trip. His dog began to pounce on the professor. The night before yesterday, Mr. Bennet heard some strange sounds. Looking out into the corridor, he saw a professor walking along the corridor on all fours, fully leaning on his feet and hanging his head between his hands. Seeing this, Mr. Bennet asked if he needed help, but the professor growled something and ran away.
Together with Mr. Bennett, his bride, the daughter of a professor, comes to the detective, who says that she was woken up by a dog barking last night. Waking up, she looked out the window on the third floor and with horror saw her father's face in front of her. Dr. Watson, who is present here, is trying to determine what professors may have mental and physical illnesses. The whole point is that such strange things happen to him periodically, but he is still in his right mind and mind.
The great detective decides to visit the professor on the pretext of an appointment. However, the professor remembers very well that he did not make an appointment. Holmes inspects the house. The professor could reach the window of his daughter on the third floor only through ivy and a drainpipe, which is almost impossible for a normal person to do.
The great detective also finds out that the professor receives letters from London from a certain Czech Dorak. Paying attention to the dates of receipt of letters, Holmes notices that attacks of the professor happen every nine days. Most likely, he is taking some kind of remedy that was recommended to him in Prague.
In the evening, hiding, Holmes and Watson see how the professor leaves the house, gets on all fours and walks up to the ivy-covered wall. He nimbly climbs the wall, flying from branch to branch. Going down, he again gets on all fours and goes home, but then his dog, breaking the chain, rushes at him.
Having provided medical assistance to the professor, Holmes, Watson and Bennet open the box. There they find a letter stating that the professor was offered to use anti-aging serum. But it is not difficult for one who tries to put himself above Mother Nature to slide down.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE
On a deserted beach, a person dies whose body is streaked as if someone had whipped him. Sherlock Holmes realizes that the man was killed by a poisonous jellyfish.
The retired great detective Sherlock Holmes lives in a small villa in Sussex, located on a hillside with a view of the English Channel. Not far from his house is the famous school. One morning, on the way to the beach, Holmes meets the school principal, Mr. Stackhurst. Both see a cliff teacher Teacher Fitzroy MacPherson, suffering from heart disease. Staggering like a drunk, he falls and before his death manages to say: "lion's mane." The teacher’s body is streaked, as if someone had whipped him. Here comes the mathematics teacher Jan Murdoch, an unsociable, reserved person subject to bouts of rage.
The great detective examines the situation. MacPherson spent a quarter of an hour on the beach. Arriving, he undressed, was about to plunge, but did not have time, he quickly put the Mac on his naked body and began to climb the mountain. There was no one on the beach at that moment. A note from a woman was found in the deceased’s pocket. Mr. Stackhurst reports that there was a close relationship between MacPherson and Miss Maud Bellamy.
Holmes and Mr. Stackhurst visit the girl and see Murdoch leaving her house. When asked by the school principal what he was doing there, Murdoch does not answer, a quarrel erupts between them, and the principal dismisses Murdoch.
Maud Bellamy lives with his father and older brother. She is ready to help the great detective find the killer, despite the discontent of her relatives. The girl says that she and Fitzroy wanted to get married, but hid their engagement because of his uncle. The old man could deprive Fitzroy of his inheritance if he married against his will. Murdoch courted Mod, but after her engagement to Fitzroy, his attitude changed.
A week goes by. The great detective is at a loss, makes inquiries about Murdoch, but receives no results. A police inspector comes to Holmes who suspects Murdoch’s murder. But the great detective has an idea. He recalls the scars on MacPherson's body, as if someone had put a red-hot wire mesh on his back.
The conversation is interrupted by Murdoch with Stackhurst. Murdoch's back is exactly in the same scars. Leaving the wounded man in the care of his housekeeper, Holmes leads the inspector and Stackhurst to the shore and gives the name of the killer: cyanide, or the "lion's mane" - the jellyfish brought by the current.
Recalling the last words of MacPherson, Holmes recalls that he had once read about her. Murdoch, who was only an intermediary between Maud and Fitzroy, is fully justified. The great detective admits: because of a dry towel, he decided that Fitzroy did not swim, and did not realize that the danger was not on the shore, but in the water. He often had to make fun of the police, and now cyanide avenged Scotland Yard.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE VEILED LODGER
A woman under a veil tells Sherlock Holmes how, together with her lover, she tried to get rid of her sadistic husband, a famous trainer, putting the blame on the lion, and the predator disfigured her face.
Mrs. Merrillow, the owner of the guesthouse, is contacting Sherlock Holmes. Recently, a woman called Mrs. Ronder came to her, who laid out good money for housing for three months in advance. She chose Mrs. Merrylow's house because he is standing far from the road, and Mrs. Ronder wants to live away from people. Her face is covered with a veil, but once the milkman saw him and dropped a can out of fear, it was so disfigured. At night, a woman shouts «murder!» And «you are a beast!». At Mrs. Merrillow’s offer of help, Mrs. Ronder asks to contact Sherlock Holmes and remind him of the tragedy at the circus.
The great detective promises to come in after dinner, but for now recalls the tragedy. Mrs. Ronder's husband was the owner of the circus, a huge kid who was considered one of the most famous trainers. Among the animals of the circus was an African lion, into the cage which included the Ronders. Once the circus stopped in a small village. At night, there was a lion's roar and a female cry. Ronder was found near a cell with a broken head and traces of lion's claws. Mrs. Ronder was lying at the door of the cage, and the lion tore her face. The clown and wrestler who came running drove the lion into a cage and locked it.
How the lion found himself at large is incomprehensible. Probably the couple opened the cage and he attacked them. There was nothing significant in the testimony of the witnesses, except that Mrs. Ronder kept shouting «Coward!» The case was closed as an accident, but one of the police inspectors doubted. Why did the lion, jumping out of the cage, kill Ronder, come back and attacked his wife? And why did Mrs. Ronder accuse her husband of cowardice when he was dead? So there was someone else, and the witnesses said that they heard a man's voice.
Holmes accompanied by Dr. Watson visits Mrs. Ronder. A woman, in the past of amazing beauty, now lives like a beast in a cage. For seven years she was silent, so as not to destroy one man, but now he is dead, and she wants to lighten her soul.
Mrs. Ronder grew up in a circus and from poverty married Ronder, a villain and a lout who mocked her, cheating and beating with a whip. He and the wrestler Leonardo fell in love and decided to get rid of Ronder and made a club resembling the paw of a lion, which they were going to kill the trainer.
At night, she and her husband went to feed the lion. Leonardo crept behind and hit Ronder. Mrs. Ronder opened the cage, and the lion, smelling the blood, attacked it. Instead of saving her, Leonardo escaped, and then returned along with those who escaped to screams. Now, upon learning that Leonardo was dead, she decided to speak.
Holmes sympathizes with the woman, but warns that she does not decide to lay hands on herself. In response, the woman lifts her veil and reveals her disfigured face.
A few days later, the great detective receives in the mail a vial of hydrocyanic acid and a letter in which Mrs. Ronder informs that she will follow his advice.
THE ADVENTURE OF SHOSCOMBE OLD PLACE 
On the estate of the owner of the famous racing stables, strange things happen before the competition. Sherlock Holmes discovers that a man is trying to hide the death of his sister, on whom he depends.
Sherlock Holmes is approached for help by the horse trainer of Sir Robert Norberton, who lives in the Shoscombe estate and is the owner of the famous racing stables. Sir Robert has never been married and lives on his estate with his sister, Lady Beatrice. The estate belonged to the late husband of the lady, and Sir Robert lives on a small rent owned by his sister.
Now strange things are happening on the estate. Sir Robert was head over heels in debt, his only hope was a victory at the races of his stallion Prince, England's best horse. The Prince has a half-brother, resembling him like two drops of water, but much weaker. To outwit those who secretly gather information about horses, Sir Robert takes him out for a walk instead of the Prince.
Lady Beatrice, who is no less horse-racing than her brother, has not been entering the stable for a whole week, but is only passing by in a carriage. Sir Robert himself spends all days in the stable, and nights in the old crypt in the park. It was then that the corpse of some strange person was discovered in the crypt, looking like a tramp, and a charred human bone was found in a central heating furnace.
Lady Beatrice's favorite spaniel began to howl at night, and the dog had to be given to a neighbor, the owner of the hotel. Lady Beatrice had difficulty moving because of a sore heart, and Sir Robert, who was very tender with his sister, came to her room every evening. Now he doesn’t go there - the lady has started drinking. And recently, a quarrel broke out between a brother and sister over a maid lady who could not resist the charm of Sir Robert.
Sherlock Holmes with Dr. Watson travel to the Shoskomb estate under the guise of gentleman fishermen. Friends stay in a nearby hotel. After talking with them, the owner says that Sir Robert gave him a very expensive spaniel.
The great detective weighs the facts. A week ago, something happened on the Shoskomb estate. Lady Beatrice locked herself in her room, went into a binge, and appears in public, only going for a walk. Sir Robert is obsessed with winning, as he fell into the clutches of usurers. Holmes suggests that Sir Robert killed his sister and is trying to hide it, since he depends on her financially.
Having asked the owner of the hotel a spaniel, the great detective goes for a walk. A lady carriage appears on the road. Two women are sitting in it - a young and an old woman wrapped in a shawl. Watson stops the stroller while Holmes lowers the dog. Spaniel grabs his teeth by the skirt of an old woman, who drives the dog away in a rough male voice.
Then the great detective goes to the crypt. The body of an old woman is in the sarcophagus. But there comes Sir Robert. In order not to deal with the police, he opens up to the great detective. For evidence, he brings a couple from the crew - a servant of Lady Beatrice and her husband.
Lady Beatrice passed away a week ago. So that lenders who would immediately take away the property, including the stable, did not find out, Sir Robert decided to give the husband a maid, an actor by profession, for his sister, and hide her body in a crypt before the races. But the spaniel, which howled, yearning for the mistress, prevented the plan from being implemented.
The prince wins the derby, Sir Robert receives a significant amount and restores his position in high society. The police are condescending to him, but the incident casts a slight shadow on the reputation of Sir Robert.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE RETIRED COLOURMAN
A retired Muscovite has lost his wife and his savings. Sherlock Holmes exposes him, finding out that the Muscovite killed his wife, who was cheating on him.
Mr. Josiah Amberley is turning to Sherlock Holmes for help. Mr. Amberley worked at a paint company for artists, made a small fortune, and retired at the age of sixty-one. He soon married a woman who was twenty years younger than him. Not far from Amberley lives a young doctor Ray Ernest, who, like the Muscovite, is a passionate chess player. Last week, the wife fled with Ernest, taking with her the lion's share of her husband's savings. Amberley asks Holmes to find the fugitives, but the great detective is currently busy, and Dr. Watson is sent to the Muscovite.
Amberley Manor is surrounded by a high wall, the garden is not well maintained, and the owner himself paints the house to distract himself. That day, he and his wife were going to the theater, but Mrs. Amberley, citing a headache, refused to go. Mr. Amberley showed his pantry, which looked like a bank vault. The wife had a second key, and she took away all the securities that were stored there. Near the estate, Watson always sees a tall, whiskered brunette in smoky glasses.
Holmes is not very happy with the report. In his opinion, it was necessary to find out what the neighbors think about Amberley and his wife, what was the relationship between the woman and the doctor. But he had already found out everything he needed. Amberley is known as a miser, and he was strict and exacting to his wife. It is likely that Dr. Ernest, playing chess with Amberley, played love with his wife.
The next day, Holmes sends Watson along with Amberley to a priest who lives in another city, who knows something about what happened. The astonished priest has no idea about anything, and Watson and Amberley return to the estate. There they are met by a great detective with a brunette in smoky glasses, who turns out to be a police inspector. Holmes asks Amberley where he got the bodies.
Wondering why Amberley began painting the house at such an inopportune time, Holmes decided that the smell of paint should have drowned out another smell. Sending Amberley away, he entered the house and found a gas pipe leading into the room. On the wall of the room there is an inscription: "Kill us ...".
Suspecting his wife of treason, Amberley decided to take revenge. He turned to the police and to Sherlock Holmes, so that no one would suspect anything, and out of pure bragging.
